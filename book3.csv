Banaag,([Weclome] back) [to the Anxious Clown!],4-Sep-04,""Well, well. I should've (which here means 'should have) known you'd be back to hear the tell tale of the Baudelaires. It starts off with the Baudelaiers waiting to meet their third care-taker. Her name is Aunt Josephine, a very cautious widow, whom also grammamatically corrects grammatical errors. She lives on the top of a very steep and tall hill. She is terribly cautious about everyting, for the slightest incorrect movement would bring down her house. While the Baudelaires get along with her (not at the best, of course, who would?) Aunt Josephine meets Captain Sham, a captain (obviouslly not) who happens to be Count Olaf in disguise!

R. Bird,Got a whale of a tale to tell ya lads,30-Mar-04,""Guardians of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans can be easily separated into three categories.  They are malicious (Count Olaf), benign (Uncle Monty), or useless (Aunt Josephine).  In this particular book we meet the ineffectual Aunt Josephine, the third of the Baudelaire's guardians and, perhaps, the most useless of them all.  I mean, certainly it is unfortunate that Count Olaf was their first, and continually follows them from home to home, always wearing disguises.  But he was not useless.  In fact, he moves the plots along quite nicely."||||||||||
"In """"The Wide Window"""", the unfortunate three have landed on the shores of Lake Lachrymose (lachrymose here meaning, """"given to tears or weeping"""", as I am sure the children were feeling at that moment).  They have been placed in the care of Aunt Josephine, a woman afraid of everything.  Still, this new home is not too too bleak.  The children have a large library to go through (albeit a library full of grammar books) and things appear to be going fairly smoothly until they run across their nemesis Count Olaf yet again.  This time, he is disguised as Captain Sham (love the name) and his new plans to get his hands on the orphans is just as devious as ever."||||||||||
"For vocabulary reasons alone these books are a wonder.  Any parent reading them to their children would do well to explain all the little in-jokes that appear along the way (always assuming that the adults themselves GET the jokes in the first place).  This book also is one of the first Baudelaire sagas in which the orphans actually see their guardian dispatched before their very eyes.  Of course, you can't feel too badly about Aunt Josephine's death.  She did attempt to sacrifice the orphans' lives for her own, in an act of cowardice that doomed her to death by (ugh) leeches.  All in all, a wonderful continuation of A Series of Unfortunate Events."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

The story is about 3 orphan siblings who are sent to live with their aunt Josephine who is loving yet very strange.  Aunt Josephine is afraid of everything and therefore the orphans aren't allowed to do anything but study grammar.  When the villan| Captain Sham| is introduced to the story| aunt Josephine disappears.  The kids use their clever intelligence to solve the mystery but not without very tragic events!  Or shall I say...a series of unfortunate events!|||||||
The story is entertaining but does have some education value to it as well. Lemony Snicket introduces some new vocabulary for middle readers and always gives a definition.  This book is a great choice to buy for your older kids..I'd say 8-12 years old.||||||||||

"As expected Count Olaf makes an appearance and his expected grab for the children's fortune in his latest disguise, a one-legged sea captain. Since their are ten other books in the series, it is obvious that Olaf's plan is fatally flaws in """"The Wide Window"""". However, this does not make it any less entertaining."||||||||||

"The third installment in the series is equally intelligent to match its predecessors. It is also witty enough to entertain the adult reader. Ultimatley, this is a grades children's book that captures the attention of the young target audience.

||||||||||
  By: Lemony Snicket||||||||||
||||||||||
" The first book I read this trimester was called the series of unfortunate events: the Wide Window. This book is the third in the series. Now after the Baudelaire's have just escaped from Count Olaf they are sent to there new home with there new guardian. There new guardian's name is Aunt Josephine. Her husband died in the lake they live on. Now ever since her husband died. Now she won't use the stove or touch doorknobs or answer the phone or anything. So everything is going alright until one day when they are in the market they meet this person named """"Captain Sham"""". Who the Baudelaire's know as Count Olaf. Aunt Josephine doesn't believe them though so Aunt Josephine and """"Captain Sham"""" become good friends. And soon after Aunt Josephine is killed by Count Olaf and Count Olaf makes her write a fake suicide note to trick everybody. The note says that she wants Captain Sham to have the Baudelaire's. What will happen to the Baudelaire's? Will Captain Sham be found out who he really was read to find out?"||||||||||
||||||||||
" This book was very exciting to read because it always had a lot of cliff hangers. Lemony Snicket made it feel this way because at the end of every chapter there would be another cliff hanger.  I never wanted to put this book down! I was not able to feel that I was in the book because the Baudelaire's are in such a horrible situation and sometimes the story a little bit """"out there"""". The main conflict did interest me because it was kind of like a mystery which I like. The characters we realistic but I could not imagine myself in that situation. The ending of the book was very exciting I thought it was the best part of the book."||||||||||
||||||||||
 The voice was usually in first person in the minds of one of the Baudelaire's. The author's vocabulary was very basic and very easy to understand. The author would some times go off a get sidetracked and relate something in the book to something that happened to the author in real life or something like that. The author used a lot of dialogue in the book. Because the author used so much dialogue there were a lot less descriptions. The tone seemed to go from a calm and cool tone to a screaming nervous obnoxious kind of tone. I think the author's writing was perfect.||||||||||
||||||||||
 If I had to rate this book I would give it an 8/10 because it was quite perfect but I still really loved it. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because I have read better books by the author. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody and everybody because it's not a guy or girl book and it is very enjoyable.||||||||||
||||||||||
" I thought that The Series of unfortunate Events: The Wide Window was an excellent book and that everybody should read it. Also I think that even thought the vocabulary wasn't very hard this book was still a bit hard to understand. But then later Lemony Snicket would explain it and everything would make sense. I love this book and I think you should read it also."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

Violet, Klaus, and Sunny have been placed by Mr. Poe in the home of Josephine Anwhistle, who is their second cousin's sister-in-law and who lives in a house precariously perched over Lake Lachrymose.  We know that sooner or late Count Olaf will show up in disguise in yet another attempt to gain control of the Baudelaire orphans and therefore of the Baudelaire fortune that will come to Violet when she attains her majority.  But we have seen that before and will probably see that again (and again and again).  What is so horrific this time is that there is clearly a qualitative rise in the level of horror."||||||||||
"In both of the previous volumes from Lemony Snickert, """"The Bad Beginning"""" and """"The Reptile Room,"""" there was a concerted effort to increase the vocabulary of young readers.  If Snicker himself is not taking virtually each and every opportunity to explain parenthetically what a particular word means, then we often find Violet or Klaus or some other character declaring what the definition of some new or otherwise unfamiliar term that comes up during the course of the narration and dialogue.  But in """"The Wide Window"""" because of the efforts of the woman called Aunt Josephine by the Baudelaire orphans we have the intrusion of GRAMMAR into their unfortunate lives.  Aunt Josephine is always correcting the grammar of everyone, even Sunny, whose inarticulate language should not be accused of being grammatically insufficient until it at least has words.  Furthermore, grammar becomes insidiously important to resolving the dastardly situation in which the Baudelaire orphans find themselves."||||||||||
"I remain as firmly convinced as ever that A Series of Unfortunate Events is a subversive attempt to educate as well as entertain.  I will continue to follow the plight of Violet, Klaus and Sunny (why do those last two names in combination remind me of something else?), because my heart goes out to them as they are continuously cast adrift in a heartless world where any one of the three children obviously has more brains than all of the other adults put together.  Count Olaf would be insulted by this comment, but I find myself incapable of caring less in that regard.  I do so worry over what will happen to these poor children, but I am also experiencing strong feelings of trepidation (a word that means a growing sense of fear) that there are worst things beyond definitions and grammar down the road for the Baudelaires.  Perhaps even...syntax."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

||||||||||
"I also appreciated that the author was not afraid to use words children would not understand.  However, when he used these words he explained them in an interesting way.  I have seen many reviewers complain about this, however, I think it is a strength of the book.  Using a word in a context that children will understand and then explaining the meaning of the word will increase a child's vocabulary.  I read one review in which the reviewer stated that children should go look words up.  I could not disagree more.  Dictionaries have their place in education.  However, children should be able to read for the simple pleasure of reading and not have to struggle with context in every book.  Studies have shown that when children struggle too much (they do not understand 10% or more words on a page) they are reading at the """"frustration level""""  This does not encourage a child to desire literacy activities.  I think this book created a wonderful enjoyable environment for children to enjoy reading and learn."||||||||||

"Finally, a reviewer also stated that she did not think children should be allowed to review this book.  I could not disagree more!  This book was written for CHILDREN!  Because of this we should be interested in what they think about this.  If this book has caused them to be excited enough to write on their own we as adults should be encouraging this.

The three youngsters, 14 year old Violet, nearly 12 year old Klaus, and the infant Sunny, are being forced to start again. The children's new guardian, Aunt Josephine, owns a respectable house balanced on the edge of the cliff overlooking Lachrymose Lake. For such an unsafe place to station a house, as it seems the support beams cannot hold the heavy building much longer, Aunt Josephine is coincidentally the most cautious person on earth. She never turns the oven or stove on (She's afraid it'll burn down the house), never answers the phone (She doesn't want to be electrocuted), never turns on the radiator (It could explode), and she never dares to touch the doorknobs (They could shatter and hit her in the eye!). As if this wasn't unfortunate enough for the poor Baudelaire's, their new guardian has one love, and seemingly one love only. Grammar. Even infant Sunny doesn't fit with Josephine's rules, since Sunny can only say one-word phrases that can usually only be translated by her siblings. And Aunt Josephine gives the stern warning about the man-eating leeches of Lachrymose Lake. Grammar lessons, cold food, a cold house, and killer leeches just down below. Couldn't possibly get worse, right? Wrong! The Baudelaire's have barely had time to settle in before Count Olaf, their treacherous relative who is after their fortune, leaps in their path again. This time, he sneaks onto the scene as Captain Sham. But what is his plan this time? As a hurricane whirls nearer and nearer to the lake, the Baudelaire's hear a crash and run to the library, only to find the wide window looking out over Lachrymose Lake has been smashed. It seems Aunt Josephine has thrown herself out the window, leaving only a suicide letter...filled with grammatical errors? It doesn't seem like Aunt Josephine to do something like that. Did the Baudelaire's new guardian really kick the bucket, or is this the nastiest plan Count Olaf has hatched yet? The Baudelaire's are now in a race against time to find the truth or they will most definitely find themselves in Count Olaf's greedy hands. In this, one of the most exciting books of the series, keep an eye out for a business card with a mistake, dangerous peppermints, dark secrets, and a risky boat ride. Lemony Snicket makes this one of the most outstanding of the first three books in the series. The humor is more, the plot line has thickened, the escapes are close, and accidents always occur. And, of course, the grammar and definition is still there, even more so, now that Aunt Josephine comes into the story. Get ready for the most thrilling book yet, and beware the leeches. As long as you haven't eaten for an hour, you'll be safe."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

Longer than either of its predecessors, it is  also more relaxed and assured  -- not that the pace is slack (far from it),  it's simply that Snicket is more at home with his bag of tricks and is  beginning to manipulate his deliberately limited, muted palette with a  master's verve.  Fearful, grammar-haunted Aunt Josephine is a wonderful,  painfully funny addition to the improbable constellation of distant  """"family"""" through which it is the Baudelaire's sad fate to pass,  and her second most notable quirk bears an interesting relationship to  Snicket's own frequent definitions of """"big words.""""  This last  feature seems to bother a lot of people, but I think these folks are trying  to bully something which is primarily an *aesthetic* device of great  flexibility into an overly-rigid pedagogical frame. These books aren't  nasty things which are -- like certain exilirs --nevertheless good for you,  they're wonderfully entertaining works of verbal art, and if one had to  troll their depths for messages, one would find, cumulatively, that these  have more to do with self-reliance and competence than with any of the  hideous treatment the Baudelaire's endure or the corpses that are left in  their wake."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

"I came to this series after already watching the tie-in movie """"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"""". I had been fairly certain I would like the series for its dark humor, and the first and second books in the series most certainly did not disappoint, so I was not too surprised when I also loved """"The Wide Window""""."||||||||||
||||||||||
Like the rest of the novels in this series| this book is very slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all| it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However| the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in the home of their cowardly Aunt Josephine over the bitterly cold Lake Lachrymose. Having already seen the movie| it was easy to imagine Meryl Streep's eccentric rendition of Aunt Josephine within the text| and the book is a delight for the extra flavor details that occur here but had to be left out of the film.|||||

"A note about the audiobook edition of this book: unlike the previous two books, which were narrated by Tim Curry, this installment of the series is narrated by """"Lemony Snicket"""" (who in this case I assume is the author, Handler). The narration is adequate, but seems somehow pale in comparison to Curry's rich undercurrents. The overall narration is still good, and worth a listen, but if you're working your way through all the audiobooks, be prepared for the change in narrators."||||||||||

This story is written by Lemony Snicket, and he does a great job throughout the story keeping suspense and pushing you to read another page. This is story can be classified as a mystery, as well as an action novel. After the Baudelaire's last adventure to their Uncle Monty's house, and seeing him killed by Count Olaf, Mr. Poe, their banker, moves them to a knew secluded location where he feels that the children will be safe from Count Olaf. Count Olaf easily finds the new home of the Baudelaires, and begins to become friends with their aunt. Only the children can see that Count Olaf is in disguise, while their aunt does not believe them. Their aunt's house is on large cliff that hangs over a large lake that is filled with flesh eating leeches. Count Olaf tricks their aunt, and sends her plummeting to her death in the leach filled lake. The children are left without a guardian, and eventually escape to find out if their aunt is still alive by sailing in a boat. They eventually find her in a cave, going half crazy from being in there by herself. They recover their aunt and attempt to take her to safety, but the leeches in the lake can smell the banana that Aunt Josephine recently ate, and they begin attacking the boat trying to get at her. A boat comes to save them, but it turns out to be Count Olaf in disguise. Count Olaf feeds Aunt Josephine to the leeches, and brings the children back to the house. Mr. Poe is there when they return and Sunny, the youngest Baudelaire, chews off Count Olaf's fake peg leg to prove to Mr. Poe that he truly is Count Olaf. Count Olaf and is supporters flee to attempt to steal the Baudelaire's fortune another time. This book was extremely exciting and always had me wanting to read another page. I love how good the plot is, and how well put together each of the characters are. The Baudelaires have an extremely peculiar way of dealing with Count Olaf, and I it's interesting seeing all the different plans that they come up with. The name for this series is very fitting because of the bad luck that the Baudelaires continuously have. It is a bit frustrating watching them fail almost every time, but it is extremely satisfying watching them succeed at the end of the story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, adventure, or action novel. I would also recommend the series on Netflix which depicts these stories very well. These books make reading enjoyable for those who can not stand the thought of looking at a book. This is a great story and I would recommend it for any age."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

Lemony Snickets tale of quirky misfortunes and schemes are entertainingly suspenseful and funny.  This story has descriptive language that easily allows the imagination to visualize it, exciting adventures and some important life lessons.  In the end, its about not giving up, no matter how grim the circumstances."||||||||||
||||||||||
The Wide Window is the third book in the Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.  In this book| the Baudelaire children| Violet| Klaus and Sunny| are moving in with their new guardian| Aunt Josephine| whose house is on the edge of a cliff above Lake Lachrymose. Aunt Josephine is a person crippled by her numerous fears from doorknobs to realtors.  Her only remaining love is grammar and she continually corrects the children. The children begin to settle in and feel safe in their new home.  However| these are the unlucky Baudelarie orphans and soon their misfortunes begin when their greatest enemy| Count Olaf| shows up disguised as a sailor. Soon| Aunt Josephine disappears and is feared dead.  It is now up to the children to try to stop Count Olaf's plan before they are delivered into his clutches once more.
||||||||||
The descriptive language throughout this story| easily allows the imagination to visualize it.  When the children first arrive at the house of Aunt Josephine| they get a perfect view of the town of Lake Lachrymose.  On page 10| the taxiarrived at the scraggly top of a tall| tall hill and the children could see the town far| far below them| the cobblestone road curling around the buildings like a tiny gray snake| and the small square of Damocles Dock with specks of people bustling around itand the inky blob of Lake Lachrymose| huge and dark as if a monster were standing over the three orphans| casting a giant shadow below them.  The language used allows the reader to play the scenes in their head and picture it playing out.|
||||||||||
The adventures of the children are exciting and nail biting.  As they search for clues in the note that Aunt Josephine left for them| the storm is raging on and the Aunt Josephines house is no longer safe.  On page 124| Aunt Josephines bedroom looked out onto the hill and the orphans could see one of the spidery metal stilts that kept Aunt Josephines house from falling into the lake.  But they could also see that this stilt had been badly damaged by the storma large black burn mark by lightning and the wind had bent the stilt into an uneasy curve.  As the children scramble to escape from the house| on page 125| the house gave another lurch and the children toppled to the floor again. Aunt Josephines house was starting to slip off the hill.  It is these adventures that captivate the reader to keep turning the pages till the very end.||||||
||||||||||
Finally| this story reminds readers of important lessons of determination and the value of family.  Beginning on page 132| the children are determined to find a sail boat so they can sail to Curdled Cave| in the middle of a hurricane| to find Aunt Josephine.  The ferry is closed due to the storm| but the children find another option; stealing a sail boat from Count Olaf and his wicked comrades.  The lesson is persistence in the face of difficulty| in order to accomplish the goal.  The fact that the Baudelaire children lost their parents| reminds us that to value the family we have and embrace each other no matter what.|||

"  The Baudelaire orphans are once again in a new home with a relative even as strange as the last two( I said strange, not evil).  Aunt Josephine.  The name gives me shivers.  But not because of the way she treated our poor antagonists, but because of the warmthless time they spent with her on her house near the lake.  The orphans gaurdian also fears many things. For example, anything electrical or the lake, which is home to the Lachrymose leeches that killed her husband.  Since Josephine is scared of anything she only makes a boring pea soup for food.  As you may have guessed, Count Olaf has to come into the story sometime.  He is Captain Sham, the average one-eyed, rough talking sailor that our Josephine may have made a love connection with.  Come on, she was head over heels in love, right?"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Window-Unfortunate-Events-Snicket-2000-02-02/product-reviews/B017WQ76PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||

Schauffel,English 341 Review,29-Apr-14,""The Wide Window by Lemony Snicket was a wonderful novel. The vocabulary that the author uses can be uncommon, which allows for deeper thinking by students. Many students are familiar with the way in which an author writes a story. This author is able to change things up and require the reader to think more critically. Throughout the book the author uses exemplary imagery in order to portray his views. Snicket focuses on creating an image for the reader. This is useful for students that are mastering the metacognitive skill of image making. The reader is also given the opportunity to use the questioner meta cognitive skill throughout the novel. Snicket provides several thought provoking questions in his writing which helps students begin this process. As a future teacher this series is a useful resource to use. The many features that promote metacognitive learning techniques are what make this novel great."",5.0 out of 5 stars,,"||||||||||

This is the 3rd installment of the Unfortunate Event Series| following the unfortunate lives of the 3 Baudelaire orphans| namely Violet (an Inventor)| Klaus (the Bookworm) & Sunny (the baby who would bite anything| and I mean anything!) after living with their departed Uncle Monty| killed by Count Olaf| but he escaped in the process of about to put him behind bars.||||

Mr Poe (in my opinion| a useless main caretaker)| a family friend who took care for the orphans fortune until Violet came to an age| brought them to live with another family member| name Mrs. Josephine Anwhistle| who lived in a house| in the edge of a hill (literally) above Lake Lachrymose| that is infested with Lachrymose Leeches| who would eat a human if they smellt food on them.||
||||||||||
Living with Aunt Josephine| who was a total grammar freak and scared of every single thing| that they have to live in a cold house| eating cold food (she's afraid of fire incidents) and the irony of being afraid of Lake Lachrymose| she actually lived on top of it. Yet counting their blessings the Baudelaire orphans| they felt lucky to be in a home with somebody that scared they actually feel secure. Until they came to a market one day and meet the Captain Sham| with a patch on one eye and a peg as one leg. but we all knew who exactly Captain Sham was| of course Aunt Josephine wasn't very keen to believe the children.|||
||||||||||
One day| Aunt Josephine died| death cause| jumping through the window| leaving the three of them to Captain Sham (Count Olaf in disguised)| and they knew Mr Poe wasn't very keen to actually believe Captain Sham was Count Olaf in disguise (He simply believed they kids are hallucinating and seeing him everywhere).|||||

The orphans tries to figure out a way to escape from the clutches of Count Olaf again when they discovered their aunt was still alive and was in hiding| somewhere. So they tried to get to her and tried to convince her to come back out to the world.|||||||||

In book the third the Baudelairs are taken by their lawyer Mr.Poe to live with Aunt Josephine at her house on the top of the mountain at Lake Lachrymose, home of the venomous Lachrymose Leeches. Aunt Josephine is scared of everything and expects diaster to always be around the corner. She thinks she will get burned by using the stove so the Baudelairs have to settle with the most awful cold cucumber soup they have ever tasted. Plus Aunt Josephine loves nothing more than grammar and constantly corrects the orphans mistakes. However Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are thankful that Count Olaf hasn't appeared in the quiet Lake Lachrymose yet. Their luck doesn't last long. It seems this time Count Olaf disguises himself as Captain Sham a sea captain!!! He totally fools Aunt Josephine but not the Baudelairs! Mysteriously Aunt Josephine seems to have commited suicide after a phone call to Captain Sham and has left the children under his care! Can the Baudelair orphans foil his evil plans once again?"||||||||||

Everyone knows that competent bankers are diligent people who try to place homeless orphans under the care of appropriate guardians, especially after the horrible things they've lived though because of the nefarious schemes of Count Olaf. Unfortunately for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, they do not have a competent banker at their disposal. They have, instead, Mr. Poe, who doesn't even know how to keep the sniffles away, and even though he doesn't possess that simple skill, is the Vice President of an influential bank."||||||||||
||||||||||
In The Wide Window| Mr. Poe finds another relative for them to live with: Aunt Josephine| who really isn't their Aunt but is their second cousin's sister-in-law| and Aunt Josephine might just be a worse guardian than Count Olaf. She's certainly a nicer person than Count Olaf is - the meanest bully on your block is nicer than Count Olaf - but she just doesn't cut it as a guardian.|||||||
||||||||||
"Poor Aunt Josephine is an """"almosteverything-o-phobe"""". When you see """"-phobe"""" at the end of a word, it identifies a fear of whatever comes before it. For example, if you were afraid of mirrors, you would be called an """"eisoptrophobe"""", which probably means that you don't like your haircut, and so can't stand to look at it. If you are afraid of words (in which case, you probably shouldn't be reading this review), you would be called a logophobe. If you were afraid of children, you would be called a pedophobe. Unfortunately for the Baudelaires, Count Olaf is not a pedophobe. Since Count Olaf is not a pedophobe, it's a shame that he is not at least chrometophobic, which would mean that he has a fear of money."||||||||||
||||||||||
"Aunt Josephine isn't afraid of everything, for she likes cold lime soup and tin cans. If she were afraid of everything, she would possess panphobia. There are so many things that Aunt Josephine is afraid of that, even though I've done exhaustive research, I haven't found words to describe her strange fears, which include a fear of docks, a fear of realtors, a fear of telephones, a fear of stoves (which might be thermophobia, a word which means """"fear of heat"""", or pyrophobia, a word which means """"fear of fire""""), she even possesses a fear of the very lake that her house hangs over precariously - precariously here means """"ready to fall into the lake at the slightest act of imbalance"""", and many, many others."||||||||||
||||||||||
"Count Olaf is back yet again with another scheme to place the Baudelaires into his custody, and he appropriately names himself, in this ridiculous and immediately see-through disguise (at least the Baudelaires, as usual, saw through it right away - which doesn't mean that they actually saw through Count Olaf as if their eyes suddenly became X-Ray machines, it simply means that they recognized him despite his disguise) as a renter of sailboats, Captain Sham. But unfortunately for everyone involved, not even Aunt Josephine, who might just be the best grammarian in the world, recognized that the word sham means """"a person who pretends to be someone or something they are not""""."||||||||||
||||||||||
This book| while dark and sad| has many exciting features| including a race across a lake in a sailboat during a hurricane (the lake is so large that it can support its own hurricane| which are usually confined to oceans) with Violet using her inventing skills to understand and operate the sails| Klaus using his reading comprehension skills to navigate the boat by reading an atlas| and Sunny using her ability to steer boats by means of manipulating the rudder.||||

And for a elementary children, this is a wonderful book. The read is relatively quick so they aren't overwhelmed by the thickness and it is still a fun story with characters that you feel terribly bad for."||||||||||
||||||||||
The prose is perfect for children. It is easy to read and filled with alliteration. Best of all| this book goes out of its way to teach vocabulary to children. Instead of filling the book with long words (for children) expecting the children to look up the words they didn't understand (which they won't)| it goes out of its way to explain the bigger words.||||||||
||||||||||
This is the story of the Baudelaire siblings and continues where the second book left off as they are taken to their Aunt Josephine's house to be taken care of. While they have some initial problems with Josephine because of her neurotic tendancies| they feel safer in her hands than when they lived Count Olaf but not as happy as they were living with Uncle Monty.  Again| another scheme is hatched by Count Olaf to take control of the fortune. Again the only thing that can help the Baudelaire orphans is their wit| wisdom| and bravery.||||||
||||||||||
You are warned at the beginning of the book| and throughout| that this book does not have a happy ending. It is part right. The book does not have the best ending| but it doesn't have the worst ending either. I'll pick up the other books| but it does appear that this book will not leave you hanging and wishing for a different ending. Actually| I prefer this ending which shows that not everything will go your way which is the norm in life and not the exception. I don't think elementary school aged children are too young to start learning this| if they haven't already.||||

"If you have young children (grades 2-6) I would highly recommend you encourage them to read this series. This would be a good step into getting them to like reading.

In a world were """"there is nothing to eat in the house"""" is too typically just code for """"there is nothing in the house I am in the mood for"""" this book could potentially offer a shift of perspective for young readers. The writer knows a lot about rhetorical analysis, so this book series might also be useful for kids to learn about the darker sides of communication, which will face them in different situations for the rest of their lives. The bright side of the story is that no matter how unreal the pain and suffering becomes in the lives of the Baudelaire children, they take care of one another and adamantly refuse to take things out on each other."||||||||||

This might not be the right story book for your kid| each one is unique and needs individual attention and care. This might be a good book to read along with your child| because many of life's more difficult issues will come into focus while reading it| it could be a chance to talk with your young reader about those issues.|||||||
