"What is there to say about this series that I haven't said eight times before already? Once again, Lemony Snicket tells the beautiful, terrifying, and delightfully sardonic tale of the poor unfortunate Baudelaire orphans; once again, the incomparable Tim Curry lends his rich voice talents to the audiobook narration in a tale-telling that is a pure joy to listen to. And if you've liked the series so far for the last eight books, nothing in """"The Carnivorous Carnival"""" is going to stop you from continuing the series further."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"In some ways, this ninth installment is the scariest of all the books so far. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are forced by circumstances to work in close proximity and daring disguise close to Count Olaf and his troupe; a constant source of tension is simply whether or not the children can continue to maintain their disguise in the company of a man who considers the changing of an identity to be a daily occurrence. At the carnival, the children are forced to pretend to be """"freaks"""" so that people can come to the carnival and laugh at and humiliate them, and it's utterly disheartening to see how this treatment has hurt and embittered the other employees at the carnival."||||||||||||||||||||

This book is much like the previous books of the Unfortunate Series collection.  The three Baudelaires| Violet| Klaus| and Sunny are being pursued by Count Olaf.  He continuously tries to steal the Baudelaire fortune| but each of his schemes are failures.  The three children are now in the hinterlands at a hideous and terrible carnival| the Caligari Carnival.  They undergo many horrible things during their stay at this carnival| but somehow get through it.  In the end though| it almost seems like Count Olaf has finally captured one of the Baudelaires| and has gotten rid of the other two| but you never know.|||||||||||
"This book was enjoyable because, the plots are so interesting, like all of the books are.  The story is written in a way that makes you want to keep reading.  Another thing I liked about it was, it was a book that you could read in a day or two.  It's not like one of those books that you have to struggle through to finish.  I also like how Sunny, the youngest Baudelaire who's only a baby, has her own kind of """"baby language"""", but you can understand what she is saying because the author translates.  For example she would say,""""Whaque"""", but she meant, """"or pretending to be surgeons."""""||||||||||||||||||||
I didn't like this book because| at times when there is a good suspenseful part of the book coming up the author will interupt in the middle of it.  He would put a story about something else| that kind of relates to what was actually happening in the book.  I also don't like how some of the characters are treated.  Even though it's fiction| some parts can get frustrating.|||||||||||||||||
"My favorite part of the book was when Count Olaf told the Baudelaires that he knew who they were all along.  It wasn't exactly the best part of the book, but it was pretty surprising.  I didn't expect that to happen at all.  All in all I thought this book was fun and very enjoyable."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

R. Bird,Woe woe misery and woe,13-Mar-04,""And on we move to the second book in the classic Series of Unfortunate Events.  If you've stumbled onto the Lemony Snicket series by chance, I wouldn't necessarily command you to read the first book before this, the second.  But you'd probably wish to do so yourself.  Following the further adventures of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans, we find our intrepid trio finally living with a relative they've grown to love.  Uncle Monty (as he prefers to be called) is a herpetologist of the finest pedigree, and he offers the siblings the first real home they've had in a while.  Unfortunately, misery continues to dog them in the form of the evil Count Olaf.  Donning one of his many disguises, Olaf does his darndest, yet again, to get his oily hands on the Baudelaire fortune.  And so forth."||||||||||||||||||||
"One of the finest books in the series, no question.  And, perhaps, one of the saddest.  After all, Uncle Monty is one of the few guardians with whom the orphans feel a real kinship.  Snicket does a lovely job displaying their affection for him which simultaneously not making you too too terribly unhappy when that joyful confluence must break apart.  Happiness is not in store for the Baudelairs for some time now.  We shouldn't be wishing it too soon.  Still, Uncle Monty's exit is a real blow to the series in that you really do come to like him before his removal from the book.  Just the same, there's plenty to love.  I, myself, was quite taken with the movie, """"Zombies In the Snow"""", that the Baudelaires watch with heavy hearts at one point in the proceedings.  Hollywood should take note - """"Zombies In the Snow"""" may be the next big storyline to hit!"||||||||||||||||||||
"For happy book involving ponies, locate one of the bazillion pony books out there.  For misery, delightful redundancy, and a truly gross villain I direct your attention to Snicket's latest.  Tis a wonderful read for the whole gosh-darn family (though he'd be loathe to say so himself)."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

Henderson,Teacher's Favorite Of The Series,4-Sep-03,""WHAT A BOOK!!! As mentioned in my review of the first three novels, I got into the Unfortunate Events series from my students. Then, I went on and read books 4-9 on my own. Out of the entire series, this has to be, IMHO, the best episode. I mean, what an ending!! Can you even believe it? I am now in eager anticipation for the 10th novel, that's due out this fall. If you are new to the series, never having read a Snickett book in your life, do yourself a favor and start at the beginning, the """"Bad Beginning"""" if you will. Then work your way up the wonderful and wildly entertaining ladder of Baudelaire stories. I wish that I could describe the situation of the story here, but I feel that any information would ruin this taught and tense and quite bleak tale. I will say this, if you are a fan of old black & white scary movies, as I am, then you will love the atmosphere of this book. Fans of the series should not miss this book. Perfect for 3rd-5th graders, and for parents looking for something new and exciting to read to their children.

The Carnivorous Carnival||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Has a bully ever picked on you and said that he was going to beat you up?  Well if they have| enlarge that feeling by one thousand| that's the way that the Baudelaires felt every day of their lives.  A couple of years ago their parents died and all three of the children went to live with their very evil uncle named Count Olaf.  Thankfully when a friend of their parents came to see how they were doing| he discovered that the children were not in a very happy place.  Since then they have been forced to move from one house to another because Count Olaf has been causing tragic things to happen to them and their guardians.  Wherever they go| Count Olaf mysteriously finds them and thinks up some evil plan| so he can get his hands on their immense fortune their parents left them.|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"Now Violet, Klaus, and Sunny have been forced to run away because Count Olaf convinced the police that they are murderers.  So they decided to disguise themselves as freaks in a carnival, where Count Olaf is hiding out. They joined the """"House Of Freaks,"""" so they can try to find out how Count Olaf is able to track them down, and other questions that they have.  The Baudelaire orphans thought that they would be safe for a while because Count Olaf still had no idea who they really were, but they were wrong.  Things always work out best for Olaf and the worst for the Orphans.  He came up with this plan that the audience of the Carnival would love to see the """"House of freaks"""" be torn apart by Lions!!"||||||||||||||||||||

Will the Baudelaires be picked first for the awful death?  Will they escape?||||||||||||||||||||

" I loved this book! There was so much drama and suspense.  I think that Lemony Snicket is a really good author who can make these sad and tragic stories turn into funny and tragic.  For instance when he tells that the Baudelaires are experiencing déjà vu, in a deadly situation, he retold that page, to make the reader think that they were experiencing déjà vu as well. I also really enjoyed the other books of this series (Unfortunate Events)."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

||||||||||||||||||||
"If you rearrange the letters in Olaf's name - something referred to as creating an anagram - you would get the word """"loaf"""". There are two different definitions of the word loaf. One of these definitions describes Count Olaf to a """"T"""". Not an actual """"T"""", of course, as that is merely an expression which means that you have described something perfectly, and we all know that Count Olaf isn't a letter of the alphabet."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"One definition of the word is a noun, and is something that while being baked makes your mouth slaver and stomach grumble, and that you might cut into slices of bread and spread peanut butter on, or stick a slice of cheese between and grill them on the stove to make a grilled cheese sandwich. The other definition of the word loaf is a verb, and it means to """"idle one's time away, typically by aimless wandering or loitering""""."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
I don't think that Count Olaf is similar to a loaf of bread any more than he is a letter of the alphabet. But most certainly| the second definition fits the nefarious Count Olaf quite well.|||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Instead of trying to have a life of his own| he insists on wasting his life away by trying to steal the life that the Baudelaire's will have when Violet comes of age. This time he doesn't try to marry her| as he did in The Bad Beginning| because if he tried that plot it would fail simply because the Baudelaire's are familiar with it and would be able to see through it immediately and defeat it as handily as they did before. In The Reptile Room| he does something much more nefarious| so nefarious| in fact| that the very nefariousness of it frightens me to such an extent that I can not bring myself to describe it. I can only say| without shuddering| that the plot involves a disguise| a snake| a hue| venom| and something that makes even grown men shudder when they come across it in the doctor's office.|||||||

Still as great now. The writing completely holds up. Sure, it won't be exactly """"adult level"""" reading, but it's not painful, childish or uninteresting like many children's books come to be as you grow older. Lemony Snicket was and is, a great writer. Authoring great books with captivating rhetoric and a true, progressive story. These miserable Bauldelaire children face horrible circumstances and grow throughout the series. The way he writes their story is not only comprehensible to both children and adults, it is very real and emotional (while the circumstances are exaggerated and play out in a strange chaos a bit like Olaf's theatre troupe) and no description I could give would do it justice. I like him, because he doesn't underestimate children in the way that he writes. It's definitely a children's book, but he doesn't dumb it down one bit. Sure, it's overall pretty dark (many Unfortunate Events occur) but he writes like this because he knows that his audience can; in fact, comprehend it in both meaning and rhetoric. Even though, I know some parents may be wondering if this is a bad book for their children because it is """"too dark"""", I would recommend not underestimating your child and base your decision on if you think they would be able to understand it. Though these children are miserable and living miserable lives, it is not a bad influence or harmful reading in the least. I have gained a lot from this series. If nothing else, I gained empathy through their strife and loved them the whole way through. I admired their strength and their bonds together. They take care of each other and love each other the entire time, no matter what happens to them. They are each their strength and they each have the ability to trust and never lose faith in the world. They are all intelligent; extremely so, and remain strong as they are thrust into an unfriendly and disappointing world, due to A Series of Unfortunate Events."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

It really is a fantastic book, just as good as the first, and a bit more humorous. One part particularly stands out in my mind, when Poe starts babbling like an idiot, which had me rolling on the floor laughing. There is so much to say about this book, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that come before this one. I just want to say that the Wide Window (book three) does not quite measure to this one, and the Wide Window is an excellent book. The story starts to get a bit darker, starting with the Miserable Mill, and the trouble doubles by the Vile Village. As a reader, start now at book two and be mindful of all that Mr. Snicket says about himself and Beatrice. Once the Ersatz Elevator is reached, her role in the series become more prominent, and he becomes hopelessly entangled with the story by the Carnivorous Carnival. *sigh* Overall, book two is a VERY, VERY good read."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

This book is one you'll remember.  It's about the three Baudelaire children: Sunny, Violet, and Klaus.  Violet, the oldest, is an inventor, Klaus, the middle, is excellent reader, and Sunny, the youngest, and likes to bite things.  After their parent's death, they were left under the care of Mr. Poe.  He sends the Baudelaires to live with people like the dreaded Count Olaf who is out to steal their fortunes.  First the Baudelares learn there going to live with their Uncle Monty.  After meeting Monty, he shows them the reptile room, a room where he keeps all of his creatures he has found.  Uncle Monty's deadliest creature was the Incredibly Deadly Viper.  But the deadliest of everybody was Stephano, Uncle Monty's assistant.  The Bauldelaire's get a suspicion about this so-called Stephano.  This book is a keepsake and I could read it again and it still would be funny, interesting, and good for families."||||||||||||||||||||

Sad, I know, that the millions of people who read the books, including yours truly, and since it has kid actors, it's going to be terrible. How do I know? Simple-- It's the same thing with Harry Potter- An excellent and achieving book series, and they ruined it by spoiling all of our imaginations on how we thought this book went. And in my opinion, I didin't like the movies because the dimwit kid actors ruined it with their horrible and cheesy acting. And I'm guessing it's going to be the same thing with this, since Klaus is about 12, and the kid who's going to play him is a terrible actor. (it figures, 'cause he's about 12 or something) The only adapted films that were good as it's original book is the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Jurassic Park but I'm going to keep this review based on A Series of Unfortunate Events."||||||||||||||||||||
"  So even this is some unfortunate news itself, the books are amazing. And if you love this series as much as I do, be like me- don't see the movies, 'cause it will spoil all of our imagainations. So buy these books, 'cause the books are so amazing and clever, and if you like they way you imagined it, don't see the movie, and stay with the books, because in most cases, the books are sooo much better than the movies.

Knowing just how morally gray and complex the series is going to get, it's all the more satisfying to start seeing Snicket laying the groundwork here, as the Baudelaires are increasingly forced into actions that are awfully close to those taken by the series' villains. More than that, it's fun to see Snicket start blowing up the formula the series clung to for so long; without spoiling anything, it's worth noting that the final pages of this will a) do something you've never seen in the series before and b) leave you with an amazing cliffhanger that will have you rushing to go pick up The Slippery Slope. And then there's some connections, long hinted, that are becoming clearer and clearer (and yet only create more questions in their wake). And if all that's not enough for you, there's the usual joys of the series: wicked humor, marvelous narration by Snicket (who just becomes more and more intriguing as things are developing), surprising plot twists, and laugh-out-loud moments that are equal parts dark and brilliant. In other words, it's just another great entry in the series, one that raises the stakes to new levels while beginning to set the groundwork for the final books in the series. What else can be said about it?"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

After their disastrous stay with the evil Count Olaf who made a swipe at the Baudelaire fortune and missed, the children aren't holding out too much hope for their new home with Dr. Montgomery Montgomery. But when the children discover that the Doctor, who would rather be known as Uncle Monty, is a friendly little man who has the most interesting, and probably only, library/reptile room, and plans to whisk them off on a trip to Peru to look for more reptiles, the children soon regain hope. But it's all too soon to do something like that, especially in such unfortunate lives. Count Olaf has pursued them to Uncle Monty's home, disguised as the doctor's assistant. Watch out for the swinging blade, the falling reading lamp, the deadly snake venom, and a thrilling car ride. Lemony Snicket does it again, as he chronicles the unfortunate adventures of the Baudelaire children (And occasionally of his own). Not only is there suspense, wit, and humor, but more lessons in grammar and definition. If you do choose to read this sad tale, don't forget to purchase books three and four, for these unfortunate events are unfortunately short. Try to drive better than Count Olaf on your way to the bookstore."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

Lemony Snicket / Daniel Handler continues the Beaudelaire saga from where he left us at the end of the first book. The style remains the same| the narrator making conversation to the readers| teaching them new words and expressions. This book is a little darker than the first one| and the three main characters do what they usually do. In fact| as far as I have noticed| the books in the ASOUE series are more like the many chapters in one larger book. We can't expect (I think) dramatic changes in the pace or the style of the narrative| but to read them and to find out about Count Olaf's next scheme will and whar will become of the three orphans is always fun.||||||||||||||

As it so happens, the orphans are out of the frying pan into the fire in this new book, a phrase that herein means, """"have gone from one bad situation where Violet was barely saved from certain unnecessary surgery, into a possible worse one by hiding in the trunk of the Count's car."""""||||||||||||||||||||
"The count, as it turns out, is barreling off with his troope of odd characters to the tent of Madame Lulu the fortune teller, who lives far out in the Hinterlands.  Like other books in this Unfortunate Series, the orphans continue to be in mortal peril (a phrase that herein means """"dreadful danger"""") as they avoid the clutches of Count Olaf.  Managing to disguise themselves as carnival freaks, they take up residence in Madame Lulu's freak show aside a humpback, a contortionist and a very glum ambidexterous fellow who can use either hands equally well."||||||||||||||||||||
Madame Lulu| who may not be all that she appears to be| has mysteriously always provided the Count with information about the Baudelaire trio| which finally explains how exactly he always knows where they are and how to find them.  She drops hints that one of the orphan's parents may have survived the fire that apparently killed them back in book #1 (The Bad Beginning)| and she gets oh-so-close to explaining the true meaning of VFD| and readers of the series and of Mr. Snicket's unauthorized biography are lead tantalizingly close to the answers for which they've sought about VFD and why Count Olaf| Jaques Snicket and Madame Lulu have tattoos or insignia of an eye on or about them.  Pieces of the puzzle are just beginning to fit together| but not...quite...|||||||||||||
"This is, of course, the ninth book in the series, and Mr. Snicket gives us some hints, as he always does, at the end of the story to the next book in the series, which I assume will be called """"The Slippery Slope.""""  Readers who have read up to this point will be delighted and enthralled by the mysteries that peek out here and there throughout the book, like prarie dogs peeking out of their burrows before quickly disappearing again.  If you have not yet read books 1-8 in the series, it is recommended that you do so before attacking """"Carnivorous Carnival"""", as much of what happens in this story won't make sense if you've not been following the sad lives of the Baudelaire orphans since the beginning.

After hitching a ride in Count Olaf's car, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find themselves at Caligari Carnival, home of Madame Lulu the fortune teller and her freaks.

This story is written by the extremely talented author, Lemony Snicket. This book is about the second unfortunate event that befalls the three Baudelaire children after the death of their parents. This book can be classified as a mystery novel, as well as an adventure. At the beginning of this story, the three children are transferred from the care of their previous, evil, guardian Count Olaf, and are brought into the care of another distant relative by the name of Uncle Monty. The three children can tell from the first moment of meeting Uncle Monty that he will be a much more loving and caring guardian than Count Olaf ever was. The children enjoy living with him for a few days until, Uncle Montys replacement arrives to aid him in his studies of reptiles. As soon as his new assistant arrives the children figure out that he not his assistant, but Count Olaf disguised as an intelligent scientist. The children persistently attempt to make his true identity known, but struggle to outsmart the devious Count Olaf, whos ultimate goal is to steal the ridiculous fortune that the Baudelaires possess. I personally love the dramatic irony that Lemony Snicket uses throughout the story. It makes the story suspenseful and surprising to see how the Baudelaire children deal with the problems that they are faced with. The solutions that the children come up with for their various problems are unthinkable and incredibly intelligent for any kids that young to think of. Count Olaf always seems to be one step ahead of the children which can be frustrating for the reader, but the final bust that the children complete makes all that frustration extremely satisfying. This book is a great read, and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a great, thrilling story from the perspective of children. They think differently than adults would, so it is very interesting to see what kind of ideas they come up with. The three children make a great team, and I love seeing them work as a cohesive unit to thwart Count Olaf. I love this series, and you would be missing out if you did not pick up this book soon!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

This book combines several different ideas and keeps younger children captivated through the entire book! I read this book before it was a hit and I adored it! There were jokes I found appropriate and funny for my kids, as well as some adult humor. It helped my kids with their vocabulary, though they did not relize it, which made it fun for them to learn. When I read this book to my kids they did not have to continuously have to ask what words meant. My children have re-read these books so many times they can hardly wait until the next volume comes out! My kids were never much readers but my 11 year old, 14 year old and even my 17 year old have all enjoyed reading this book.

The ninth book in the series, The Carnivorous Carnival, is no exception. Although it is hard to put a definite narration device on Lemony Snicket's writing style, it is closest to an non-participant, third person omniscient narration style. The narration in the story is from an unnamed character who is telling the story in flashback, where the events have already happened but no one (not the other characters in the story) knows the outcome except for the author, and even he is discovering events in a separate plot involving his beloved Beatrice as the series goes on. In fact, one of the major reasons that the narrator is investigating and telling the story of the Baudelaire children is in relation to a tragic happening to his Beatrice. In other books in the series, Snicket will give away key plot points to the audience (example: he told the reader that one of the secondary characters was going to be killed before the book's end, which is a very common thing in Snicket's morbid novels). Snicket's intriguing writing style helped to transport the audience into the world of the novels, which was a very complex and overwhelming place for the reader and the character both. In spite of the chaotic narration style, the books make you want to keep reading them, leaving you anxiously awaiting the next book in the series once you're done."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

Inside the pages of the books that this review reviews, you will find such terrible things as orphaned children, a greedy villain out to steal a fortune, an incompetent banker (the word 'incompetent' here means, 'unable to protect or even remotely assist the Baudelaire orphans in their attempts to avoid the evil Count Olaf'), a murdered relative, a harmless Incredibly Deadly Viper, the reappearance of a villain, a widowed, phobia-ridden aunt (phobia-ridden here meaning, 'an aunt too afraid to touch the doorknob, use the oven, or be near realtors'), a library devoted entirely to grammar, a house that teeters on its foundations, and leeches. Clearly, if you had any sense at all, you would not wish to read about such things."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
If you do| however| chance to pick a volume up| be sure to drop it as quick as you can| kick dirt over it so no one else can find it| and run in the opposite direction. Because if you do pick it up you will find| to your horror and misery| that the tales recorded within are most definitely unsuited to such a person as you. Tales of a fortune-stealing man named Count Olaf out to get a trio of clever and incredibly unlucky children are not| I am sure| the sort of thing you would enjoy. So I recommend that you purchase another book| perhaps a volume by Lenoy M. Setnick entitled THE PONY PARTY| the first of his series called THE LUCKIEST KIDS IN THE WORLD!| which can be found by purchasing Mr. Snicket's unauthorized autobiography in hardcover and turning the dust jacket inside out.||||||||

We finally get to find out how Olaf always knew where the Baudelaires were, and where one of the Baudelaire parents or Lemony Snicket might be. There was a nice build of suspense in the end because you had no idea who was going to be thrown in the pit, and you did not know that this book would end with such a cliffhanger."||||||||||||||||||||

I liked that the book ended with such suspense because it has gotten me to want to read the next book to see what happens. This book is definitely not as boring as some of the others were. I think the suspense will continue to build hopefully to a good ending.||||||||||||||||||||

Laced with dark humor and Snicket's signature warnings about continuing to read the book because of the horrible things the Baudelaires will go through| The Carnivorous Carnival is another excellent entry by Lemony Snicket and with this book and the previous one Snicket has brought some fresh energy to a series that had a sense of a paint by numbers formula. No longer are the stories resolved neatly by book's end being led to a conclusion which may be a few books away but feels immediate and fraught with tension and danger.|||||||||||||||||||

Having read the previous reviews, I wonder if the negative ones would have been a little kinder to the books if the reviewers had grasped the underlying structures that drive these writings, and see that these are books of humor and that their subject matter is the salvation of children from the obsessive stupidity, the greed, and the cruelty with which they are often treated by adults. They are stories that laugh at the impermanency of both good and evil, and that hold in high esteem the cleverness and resourcefulness of children."||||||||||||||||||||
"The author (Daniel Handler, here with the 'nom de plume' """"Lemony Snicket"""") has managed to sterilize his writing so that it is entirely denuded of emotionality and sentimentality; this is a clever move that allows him to touch the most horrendous and evil themes without flinching or turning the reader off. When the three Baudelaire children are informed that both parents have died and their home burned to the ground, it is done by Mr. Poe, a bumbling bank offical who is now their guardian and the trustee of their parent's vast fortune. After telling them that both parents perished in the fire he adds """"perish means 'killed.'"""" The children don't fall apart, but rather hold hands and walk off the beach with Mr. Poe, ready to engage in the """"Bad Beginning"""" which is the title of the first book."||||||||||||||||||||
"Lemony Snicket's prose is dry and simple, and he uses and elaborates some of the writing techniques that were abandoned a hundred years ago with the decline of Victorian prose: he, the author, is constantly intruding himself into the narrative, directly addressing the reader with advice, comments, and even prophetic remarks about how the story line will evolve.For example, a few pages previously he has announced that Uncle Monty, a wonderful and kind person, will soon die. Now Lemony comments (to the reader): """"For no matter how safe and happy the three children felt, no matter how comforting Uncle Monty's words were, you and I know that soon Uncle Monty will be dead and the Baudeliares will be miserable once again."""" It is by means of these techniques that the author can get away with what he writes about (brutal cruelty, pointless horrors) without being brutally cruel or subjecting his young readers to pointless horrors. But, and this is a large but: the young reader must be intelligent enough to transcend the prose and see the unreality and the humor of what is being presented. More than novels, these book suggest to me an elaborate Punch and Judy show conducted by a genial man who can have the figures commit all sorts of mayhem upon each other, while the young children in the audience don't think for a moment that Punch or Judy are """"real;"""" they just go along with the pretense and enjoy the show. In fact, they could not enjoy themselves if the figures really were alive. This author makes no pretense of realism in his writing, and therefore the mayhem he creates is ultimately funny."||||||||||||||||||||
"Snicket certainly warns the reader: """"I'm sorry to say the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant;"""" or """"If you have picked up this book with the hope of finding a simple and cheery tale, I'm afraid you've picked up the wrong book altogether;"""" or """"All the stories about these three children are unhappy and wretched, and the one you are holding may be the worst one of all."""" Those are parts of each of the three notices that appear in the back cover of each volume. No deception here. Be forewarned."||||||||||||||||||||
"I can see where some parents would think of the books as designed to undermine adult authority, and would believe them to be subversive if not downright seditious. But I can't fathom intelligent children being hurt by these books, or their self discipline in any way being lessened by them; on the contrary, I believe it will make them wiser (and perhaps better) people. Highly recommended for normal children with a sense of humor, and for the parents who raised them."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

In the first book, Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire find out that their parents have died in a terrible fire that burned their entire house down. Mr. Poe, their gaurdian, sent them to live with Count Olaf, a relative of the Baudelaires. But after living with him for a short time, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny discover that Count Olaf is after the fortune they inherited from their parents and will do anything to get the fortune for himself. The Baudelaires finally escaped from him, but that's only the beginning. Mr. Poe keeps on sending the children to new gaurdians, but every time, Count Olaf is there, disguised as someone in hopes of getting his hands on the children and the fortune.

The reason for this simply being| that Uncle Monty is the only guardian they like and that they enjoy being with.|||||||||||||||||||

This book is such an interesting read| some may call it 'unputdownable'. It begins with them travelling along a dreadfully smelly road| but soon their spirits lighten up once they see their uncle monty| the snakes in the reptile room and the fact they all had their own rooms !|||||||||||||||||
Violet feels right at home designing and ttesting traps for the snakes the planned to catch on their expedition to Peru| Klaus certainly enjoyed all the reserching and the library| and Sunny became the best of friends with the deadly viper| which of course was a mis-nomer which when you read it you will understand.|||||||||||||||||
Everything is fine until their life is ruined - AGAIN| by the treacherous Count Olaf| but no one can beat the baudlaire kids| so pick this book up and prepare for yet another great book by lemony Snicket and all in all enjoy reading about the mamba du mal to Count olafs unbelievable disguise.|||||||||||||||||

Mahoney,This Book is Great!!,29-May-03,""Lemony Snickets books are full of mystery and suspense.  That's why I like to read them.  His books are really hard to put down.  The endings leave you hanging on a string and you have to get the sequel.  So far he has written nine books and is on his tenth.  I can't wait for it to come out.  Over the year at John Winthrop I have read the ninth book.  The title is """"The Carnivores Carnival"""".  Out of all of his books in """"The Series of Unfortunate Events"""" this book has had the most suspense.  Some people have read the first book and stopped because they couldn't get into the book.  But, I didn't stop because the way he ended the books you couldn't stop reading them.  The Carnivores Carnival is about three children who have the worst life you could ever possibly imagine.  Their life is miserable.  There is something bad waiting around every turn.  In every book they find a clue on what they are trying to find out.  They have come close to it but it has never been correct and their lives still stay miserable.  What makes the book funny is that while Lemony Snicket writes the book he brings up things from the past in his life and thinks of everything in the book to be real.  Hopefully the tenth book will come out this summer so I can get to read that book.  Lemony Snickets books are great."||||||||||||||||||||

After Count Olaf's plan to get the Baudelaire orphans money failed| he was lucky enough to escape. The three siblings| Violet (the inventor)| Klaus (the reader) and Sunny (the biter) are placed with a relative in the country. Dr. Montgomery is a herpetologist| thus he studies snakes| and he receives the three children in an extremely friendly and loving way. Uncle Morty teaches the kids about snakes and reptiles and everyone is living happily| but grimmer times will soon arrive. Count Olaf reappears and he is meaner than before| his plot to obtain the riches from Baudelaire orphans is heinous and the count will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.|||||||||||||
"The author continues using the technique of defining words that do not need be defined in his attempt to ridicule some children books. He even lets Klaus express the frustration some readers may feel when Mr. Poe is explaining to him what ridicule means and Klaus snaps back """"I know what 'ridicule' means"""". Snicket also shows what a great sense of humor he has and he uses it to criticize some legendary classics, like Little Red Riding Hood and The Boy Who Cried Wolf. For example, in the case of the latter, he states that the moral of the story is not that people should not lie, but """"Never live somewhere where wolves are running around loose"""".

When we last left the poor unfortunate Baudelaire siblings they had hidden themselves in the trunk of evil Count Olaf's car and were being rushed away from the burning Heimlich Hospital.  Klaus and Sunny had just saved Violet from having her brain removed.  It was terrible.||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"But things become even worse.  The Baudelaires find themselves at the Caligari Carnival out in the Hinterlands.  They are forced to don disguises from Olaf's trunk and pretend to be freaks while they try to discover from Olaf and the mysterious Madame Lulu secrets about their parents.  Madame Lulu's motto is """"to give people what they want"""" and she always seems to give Olaf just what he wants."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
No one recognizes the Baudelaires| but Olaf has a devilish plan cooked up anyway.  He wants to feed a freak to some starving lions to bring in more money.  Oh| it's so dreadful.  There's so much that goes on.  The Baudelaires begin to learn about the V.F.D. and what it is and was and they gain some more knowledge about the questions they have.||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Knowledge comes at a price| however| and the price that the Baudelaires and others pay is very high.  THE CARNIVOROUS CARNIVAL becomes so violent and the book ends in a most horrific way.  Read the book if you must| but be warned that there is no happy ending here.|||||||||||||||||

One would think that this is inherently a bad thing. However, given where they are going, and the disguises they find in the trunk, it actually becomes a good thing (as do most bad things in these stories...every failure is usually offset by a delightful rebound)."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"They find themselves at the Caligari Carnival, run by Madame Lulu, who speaks in that odd halting, accented tone that Olaf did in The Ersatz Elevator. They eavesdrop on Count Olaf while he's receiving advice from the Madame Lulu, who has a crystal ball (what would a carnival be without a crystal ball?). The Baudelaire's decide that they need to remain close to what is happening here, and they don some of the disguises they came across and apply for jobs as freaks at the carnival. Sunny puts on the beard that Count Olaf wore while pretending to be Stephano in The Reptile Room, and becomes Chabo the wolf baby, half wolf, half human. Klaus and Violet drape a large shirt over themselves, pretending to have two heads, and while auditioning for their parts in the freak show at the Carnival, they are asked to eat an ear of corn, at which they fail miserably. For reasons only they can understand, Olaf's hench-fools think that's hysterical, and with Chabo's growling (a riot in themselves) they get the job. Hysterically, Klaus and Violet's """"job"""" is to eat an ear of corn together, as crowds love """"sloppy eating""""."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Snicket often makes social and/or political commentary that sometimes is rather well hidden| and at other times| such as in this book| is quite blatant. When the Baudelaire's are shown to their hammocks in the freak caravan| we realize that he's being blatant here. Amongst the freaks are a hunchback| a contortionist| and an ambidextrous man who is shamed at his agility. These really aren't freaks at all| especially not Kevin. Ambidexterity is a gift!!|||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Events transpire| and the Baudelaire's learn a terrible secret about Madame Lulu. This secret also gives them further insight into V.F.D.; however| Count Olaf has brought some lions to the Carnival| and it is decided that the freaks will be fed to the lions! This is surely a situation that the Baudelaire's cannot possibly escape.|||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
All of the elements that make these books such a wonder are in full force here| and  Sunny beginning to learn a skill of her own. Violet is an inventor| Klaus a researcher| and it seems that Sunny has some inherent abilities toward constructing recipes.|||||||||||||||||

"I came to this series after already watching the tie-in movie """"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"""". I had been fairly certain I would like the series for its dark humor, and the first book in the series - """"The Bad Beginning"""" - most certainly did not disappoint, so I was not too surprised when I also loved """"The Reptile Room""""."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Like the rest of the novels in this series| this book is very slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all| it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However| the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in the home of their kind-but-eccentric Uncle Monty. Having already seen the movie| it was a bit tricky for me to adjust from Billy Connolly's delightful and warm characterization of Uncle Monty to the somewhat cooler and more oblivious Uncle Monty presented here on page| but the characterization fits more easily within the confines of the story.|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
A note about the audiobook edition of this book: this installation in the series is narrated by Tim Curry. He narrates the story superbly and adds a wonderful layer of creepy inflection over the entire affair. The pacing is excellent and the overall effect on the reader is very immersive and well worth the listen.||||||||||||||||||||

The three books are each divided into 13 chapters as one would imagine.  Not so lengthy that you can't read two aloud in one night.  It begins as one expects with the Baudelaires being thrown into the evil clutches of Count Olaf| who immediately starts his sinister plan to work with the help of his filthy assistants.  The orphans gain some comfort from their next door neighbor| Judge Strauss| but as they soon learn adults aren't much help and they are forced to pry themselves free from the clutches of Olaf themselves.|||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Books 2 and 3 take Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine in turn.  Hard to picture them as anyone other than Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep now.  The two adventures once again find the orphans matching wits with Count Olaf as he takes on fiendish disguises which all too easily fool the adults| who once again prove no help at all to the orphans.  Whereas in Book the Second we get a fantastical story of reptiles| mostly charming snakes| in Book the Third we get quite a little study in grammar that ultimately leads to poor Aunt Josphine's demise.|||||||||||||||||

"Mr. Poe is perhaps the most troublesome character in these tales as one would expect after being fooled each time he might wisen up a little, but sadly not, and the kids find themselves moving from one ill-fated adventure to another, all in good humor of course as not to give young readers too much fright."",5.0 out of 5 stars,,"||||||||||||||||||||

I mean horrible.,19-Mar-05,""Don't believe a thing Lemony Snicket says - the only way these books of woe will have you crying is if you laugh really, really hard."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"Lemony Snicket has a fresh, unique, and hilarious writing style. He speaks very plainly, explaining things along the way with his signature phrase, """"a word which here means"""". Always he reminds his readers that they do not have to read these awful books that will only bring nights of wailing and weeping, although he has sworn to record them. Sometimes Snicket is deliciously non-sequitur - """"...you would run much slower if you were dragging something behind you, like a knapsack or a sheriff"""". And each book is morbidly dedicated to a so far unknown woman named Beatrice. """"Beatrice - Darling, dearest, dead."""""||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Although the books are sold as children's books (or perhaps because of it)| I would recommend these books to adults who are secure enough in their maturity to read them. Some of the humor might actually be hard for young children to understand unless they are great cynics already.|||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"The basic plot of the story is this: three siblings - Violet, Claus, and Sunny Baudelaire - lose their parents in a fire. They are sent off to live with their """"uncle"""", Count Olaf. Olaf is a horrible, detestable man who will do anything, however evil and dishonorable, to get his hands on the fortune that the Baudelaires will inherit as soon as Violet is of age. The Baudelaires find themselves in frustratingly hopeless and distressing situations, mostly because of the (oh, so aggravating!) thickheadedness of the adults around them. So using their special skills, Violet, Claus, and Sunny try and find solutions themselves - by inventing, researching, and biting things, respectively. They wriggle out of immediate danger, but there is never exactly a happy ending - instead, one that is relieved but forebodes more calamity."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
The plot seems very repetitive through the fourth book - the Baudelaires live with various guardians and end up in equally desperate situations with Olaf on their tail. But don't be discouraged! By the fifth book| a larger picture begins to show. A whole mystery opens up - the VFD. What caused the fire which in which the Baudelaires' parents perished? Why are do all their guardians have so much in common? I won't give anything away| but the mystery builds through the rest of the books. The reader picks up little clues and tries to piece things together. The final two books have not been written yet| so don't expect a complete answer soon.|||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
There are eleven books| but they are relatively small and quick reads. When you get through them| read The Unauthorized Autobiography. Snicket himself is an obscure sort of character in his books - he hasn't participated in any action yet| but it seems that he may have to soon. The Authobiography gives loads of tantalizing information (or just more questions) about the VFD.|||||||||||||||||

They are are my least favorite in the series, simply because they get much better after those three.  Especially after book 5, however since this is a 1-3 box set, you will have to go read my reviews for the other box-sets if you want to compare the quality of these ones to the ones that proceed them."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
  Book One: The Bad Beginning - Well in book one we our introduced to the Baudelaire's| they are quite happy children that live with their parents in a large house| and are very rich.  These children include: Violet| a 14 year old whom is a genius inventor| and will tie her hair up when in the midst of inventing| Klaus| her 12 year old brother whom is a genius of books; he can't get enough of them| and is quite often a well of information| and last but not least Sunny| a small baby whom is still crawling| can't really talk yet except with made up words| but she has four extremely long & sharp teeth.|||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
  Now| so the story goes| the Baudelare children were playing on the beach| when they became orphans| this is where their misfortunes begin| because they must live with a guardian now| a relative or something. Well| they end up living with Count Olaf| and really I don't want to tell you more of that book| or it will ruin the story for you.|||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
  NOTICE: If you don't want ANYTHING in the books after book 1 spoiled DON'T read the next to descriptions of the books| skip them and read my summary.|||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
  Book Two: The Reptile Room - In this book the Baudelaire's have escaped Count Olaf and Mr. Poe has placed them in the care of Dr. Montgomery Montgomery| or their Uncle Monty. He is a man whom studies reptiles and has many interesting and dangerous reptiles. The Baudelaire's begin to feel that they will actually enjoy living there too| but is it safe for them to get comfortable?||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
  Uncle Monty is a lot of fun| and it's great seeing all the reptiles| in fact| this is the book that inspired me to become a herpetologist myself| with a collection of 14 reptiles currently| and counting.  This is the most joyful book| it is sad| in places| but the orphans really have a lot of joy with Monty| which makes the subsequent books even more bittersweet.|||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"  Book Three: The Wide Window - After they had to leave Uncle Monty's house(I wont say why), Mr. Poe has placed them in their care of their paranoid grammar obsessed Aunt Josephine. A woman who's husband died a couple years back and wont use stoves in fear that she set the house on fire or something like that. Her house """"barely"""" sits on a ledge next to lake Lachreymose by Domocles Dock. The Baudelaire's don't enjoy living there very much, but how long will it last anyways?"||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"  Well, I would say that """"The Series of Unfortunate Events"""" is for those who are morbid at heart. These books have an extremely morbid sense of humor, and a hell of a lot of social commentary for such short books are supposedly for children.  They all have a great sense of humor, which may take some time to get used to, and even though book 4 is the lowest rated on Amazon.com, I'd say that is where the books really hit their stride. That's where I really began to enjoy the books and their unique sense of humor."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
  Whether you are young or old| though I think older people may enjoy these a little more cause they can understand them better (and most the people I know who've read them have been at least my age| 19yrs)| you'll probably still enjoy them| they're fun books| and they have some things to teach| even though they don't seem like it.||||||||||||||

His reptile room, where he keeps many of his snakes plays a key point in the plot."||||||||||||||||||||

As many would expect| Count Olaf reappears disguised as Uncle Monty's new assistant| with his sights set on the family fortune. The means by which he makes his attempt to gain the fortune stresses the superior intellect of the children and entertains the reading audience. Because the other adults in the picture are oblivious to Count Olaf's scheming| the story takes humorous twists that are obviously frustrating to the children. Readers will be eagerly anticipating how Count Olaf's fraud is exposed.|||||||||||||||||

Lemony Snicket aka Daniel Handler really does a good job of making the 3 Baudelaire orphans lives seem so [bad], that I couldnt help but think that maybe possibly something good would happen to these kids.  Of course, when something remotely good happens, 5 bad things happen soon after.  It seems as if everyone is working against these orphans, including the person in charge of their welfare, a dull man named Mr. Poe.  These books are great light reading...a favorite of mine to read in the tub and finish in one sitting.

Three children, the Baudelaires, have had the most miserable lives anyone can have! Their parents died in a fire, they got chased around by a horrible, awful, unbearable villain named Count Olaf, and whenever they finally found a guardian they liked something bad happened to her/him. Count Olaf is always trying to get the Baudelaire's enormous fortune. He always has a trick up his sleeve. The books are so interesting. I get locked into them and can't stop reading. I always want to know what happens to the poor Baudelaires. I want to know who Count Olaf is disguising himself as and what he is going to do to the orphans. Count Olaf is very clever, but so are the Baudelaires. Violet, 14, is an excellent inventor and always invents something right before something teribble happens to her and her siblings. Klaus, 12, is an awesome reader and always reads and researches what they need to know about Count Olaf's plan. Sunny, a baby, is a very clever baby. She can talk to her brother and sister and she can understand what other people are saying. She talks in baby talk, though, using words like """"Jook!"""" or """"Yeeka!"""" Her siblings can still understand her. She has 4 very sharp teeth that always come in handy in the three siblings' plan to stop Count Olaf. I have read books 1-6 in the series and I have never gotten bored. Sometimes I read for hours and try to figure out Count Olaf's sneaky plan! These are some of my favorite books of all time.

The Bad Beginning is about the three rich Baudelaire orphans who have to go live with their distant relative| Count Olaf| who is the epitome of evil. He forms a plot to marry Violet| the eldest| to get their money| but the plan is discovered and Violet fixes it so that the marriage was false. Olaf runs away with his cronies| and Violet| Klaus (the middle child) and Sunny (the youngest| who's only a baby and can't talk yet) go and live with another relative.||||||||||||
The Reptile Room: takes over where The Bad Beginning left off. The orphans are headed down Lousy Lane to go live with their scientist relative| Montgomery Montgomery.  He has a large house with a huge museum of reptiles (hence| THE REPTILE ROOM). Montgomery is actually nice to the orphans| and he says that they're all going on an expedition to a foreign country to look for reptiles. All of them are really excited| until the new helper-man that Montgomery hired named Stefano is discovered to be the evil Count Olaf. Olaf kills Montgomery| and the kids try and get their guardian| Mr. Poe| to understand that Stefano is a murderer. Everything ends up not-so-great| and Stefano runs away again with his cronies while the children go to a new relative's.||||||||||||
The Wide Window: takes place at Lake Lachrymose where the orphans have come to live with their widowed Aunt Josephine who's an incredible scaredy-cat. She's an fanatic about the English language| and she has to have perfect grammar. The orphans and Josephine meet a 'seafarer' named Captain Sham| who turns out to be Count Olaf (are we starting to see a pattern here?)| and Aunt Josephine kind of develops a crush on him. The children try to warn her| but alas. Aunt Josephine runs away to a cave| and leaves the children a note with grammatical mistakes that tells where she is. The children go to find her| and she is a COMPLETE wimp and eventually ends up in the lake and eaten by leeches. The children escape from Count Olaf's clutches (he'd tried to adopt them after Aunt Josephine had supposedly deserted them). Mr. Poe was oblivious to this| even after the kids had warned him. But| eventually| Olaf gets away adn the kids go off to another relative.|||||||||||
"My opinion: One of the best things about these books are the pictures, because they're really funny and interesting to look at. Also, even though the plot stays mostly the same throughout every book, you never get tired of it, because everything is JUST SO FUNNY.

"The people who give this and the rest of the books a low rating do so with the justification that they are """"repetitive"""" and """"unoriginal."""" First off, one who thinks these books are repetitive has very little imagination and patience. They can't see beyond the storyline when judging a book--they can't understand the author's references to himself while narrating, they can't understand why the books were purposefully made to be repetitive, and they can't understand that there is more to the series than """"oh no Count Olaf's trying to kill us!"""""||||||||||||||||||||
Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) wrote the books in a repetitive manner because it's his version of your typical children's book. But these are hardly typical| and that's what he's tried to get across. Count Olaf is not a normal villain| he is disgusting and horrible in a darkly humorous way. Similarly| anyone who takes the orphan's manner of getting out of situations as lame has a poor sense of humor.|||||||||||||||||
Those who greatly dislike the books are not likely to have picked up on clues about the overall mystery of the plot line. I agree| if you take away the underlying mystery that involves VFD and Lemony Snicket himself| the books are amusing but quite dull. In the later books| and in Lemony Snicket's Unauthorized Autobiography| the mystery grows to overwhelming proportions you yearn to solve. Moreover| there's the slight theme concerned with noble causes| and how easily the line that divides one's good intentions and evil deeds can become blurred.||||||||||||||
"It's just my opinion. One may dislike it, but I hope they're for other reasons than the fact they can't see beyond a simple central plot. In any case, they're great books, and I definitely recommend them."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

Slaughter,I can't wait until my toddler grows up!,9-Jan-02,""These books are amazing. As a big fan of quality children's writing, I was completely engrossed in these books. Each narrative is strong, compelling, and unique. The author retains his structure while not allowing the plots to get too formulatic and boring. While you can see by the end of book 2 that a pattern is emerging (that is all I'll say here) -- and the fact that the series continues -- it seems to me that this helps the reader know that somehow the children will survive whatever ordeal they find themselves in, which is a great device. It alleviates our anxiety, and more importantly, a child's anxiety, that real harm might come to the kids, while letting us relax enough to enjoy the story as it unfolds."||||||||||||||||||||
I once read an essay by Maurice Sendac in which he described how hard it was to get published. The common thinking was that you can't wirte about things that scare children| like death. These dark fears are tabboo. He argued that children do think about such things| and that writing about them in a careful way respects children and their real concerns and provides them with a place to air their deepest fears. The success of his books| I believe| is in large part due to his respect for children.||||||||||||||||
These books| I believe| provide the same sort of thing| though they are much funnier than Sendac. The children are so bright and clever that they are wonderful heros. The grownups never seem to listen to them or realize that these are really insightful and intelligent people. I suppose this might be interpreted by some parents as undermining adult authority| but the writing is so good and the characters so ridiculous that bright kids would not see them as actual representations of real adults. This is very much along the lines of Roald Dahl| who is known for his horrible grownups who treat children as foolish little no-nothings. Children are much more insightful than many adults give them credit for| and bright kids love reading stories in which they can be the smart heros| solving the mysteries and beating the villain. This has been such a standard plot device for so long that I needn't list how many classic books have used it successfully. Just a few are the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series| Matilda (and many of Dahl's books)| Treasure Island| The wonderful Tintin series| of course harry Potter| etc.| etc.). Kids love being the heros| and| like Harry Potter and many of these others| the key is in making the children heros| while allowing them to be terribly afraid while scary things are happening to them. Without this fear they feel| the stories would| of ocurse| be flat and stale and not ring true.
If Snicket didn't apply the assorted techniques to prepare his readers| I might feel otherwise| but I would have LOVED these books as a kid| and I can't wait until my 3.5 yr old is old enough to read them to her (in several years). Finally| one must read things as they are intended. Many of Grimm's Fairy Tales are very scary and violent| but alas| they are fairy tales. These books are contempory fairy tales. If they one day get produced as movies| they should be made by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands| Batman| The Nightmare Before Christmas| etc.) who is one of the few people who could give them that air of unreality which would make them so thrilling and fun| without terrifying children and scaring them for life.|||||||||
"These are fantastic books which I highly recommend buying for the children in your life -- those who are old and bright enough to appreciate them as they are intended. Before you give them away as a gift, though, do sit down for a couple hours one stormy evening, make some tea, turn off the blasted television, and enjoy (at least the first of) these highly entertaining books."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

To say these books are only for kids is the same as saying Bugs Bunny cartoons are only for kids - BULL!"||||||||||||||||||||
"The Carnivorous Carnival"""" is Book the Ninth in the proposed 13-book series - in this one, we re-join Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny Beaudelaire in the trunk of Count Olaf's long, sinister black getaway car; the orphans hid there at the end of """"The Hostile Hospital"""" as their only means of escape, since everyone is looking for them after the local paper, """"The Daily Punctilio,"""" branded them murderers of Count Omar - who, in reality, is Count Olaf, and he is very much alive."||||||||||||||||||||
Count Olaf drives his troupe of theater performers/criminals way out to the hinterlands| to the Caligari Carnival.  There they greet Madame Lulu| the owner of the carnival and a personal friend of Count Olaf.  At their first opportunity| the children escape the trunk of the car - but where to go| now that they are stuck way out in the hinterlands| with everyone thinking they are murderers?|||||||||||||||
Easy - they adapt Count Olaf's methods of trickery and disguise.  In each previous book| Count Olaf has found the orphans in their newest home and| in disguise| plots to get his hands on them and their fortune.  Now it's the Beaudelaire siblings' turn - using stuff found in the count's own disguise kit| the children dress themselves up as freaks and actually join the carnival with Violet and Klaus as the two-headed freak Beverly/Elliot| and Sunny donning an old beard Olaf wore from a previous book and becoming Chabo the Wolf Baby.  When they join the contortionist| hunchback| and ambidextrous man in the freak show at Madame Lulu's House of Freaks| right under Count Olaf's nose| the orphans think they will finally be able to learn the secrets of V.F.D. and whether one of their parents really may have survived the fire that had made them orphans in the first place.|||||||||||
"But everything is not what it seems at Caligari Carnival, and soon the Beaudelaire's are in more trouble than ever before.  After eight books of Olaf in disguise trying to steal the Beaudelaire children (and their fortune), it was a great twist to find the children in diguise trying to thwart Olaf's latest scheme!  Really, these books are THE BOMB, funny and exciting and real page-turners for anyone of any age.  With each book we feel we are closer to finding out all the secrets hinted at, but then something happens to tease our curiosity even more, making us wait breathlessly for the next installment.  I thought """"The Hostile Hospital"""" ended on a cliffhanger, that was NOTHING compared to """"The Carnivorous Carnival,"""" and with 4 more books to go (there will be 13 total, as there are 13 chapters in each book chronicling the sad, unlucky lives of these unfortunate orphans), Lemony Snicket will surely drive us readers crazy by the end with our unanswered questions about V.F.D., Beatrice, the possible survival of one of the Beaudelaire parents, what the eye tattoos mean, and if Count Olaf will ever get his just desserts.  Heartily recommended but you have to start with Book One and read them in order, or they won't make sense.

Henderson,A Teacher's Review,21-Jul-03,""As a teacher, I am constantly looking for the newest and biggest book to read to my students. During my travels, I came across a book entitled """"The Bad Beginning"""" by Lemony Snickett. I decided to take a chance and purchase the book. I sat down at home and read the entire book in about two and a half hours, and it was one of the most enjoyable stories that I had read in a long time! I tried the book out on the kids, and they just ate it up. The students couldn't get enough of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire....and to be quite honest, neither could I!! Soon after reading the first book, I purchased books two and three, and not to my surprise they were just as good! I again read these books to the students, and they again ate them up!!! Unfortunately, by the time we had finished the third book, the school year was over. However, I went on to finish my collection by getting books four through nine. I love these stories! The black humor that they contain should be that of a Coen Brothers film. The kids got every joke, and they totally fell in love with Snickett's radically original storytelling - explaining things in detail, translating Sunny's baby talk, and giving hilarious backstory. My peers often make fun of me because I read so much children's literature, but I have recommended these books to all of my friends. I even believe that these books are more interesting and fun to read than the Harry Potter series...but thats just me! I would recommend this book to parents of third and fourth grade students (it might be a little unfullfilling to the fiercly loyal fifth grade Harry Potter crowd) and also to adults who are unfamiliar with the series. A truly remarkable find and the most entertaining children's novels since Roald Dahl.

||||||||||||||||||||
  By:Lemony Snicket||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
 This is the 3rd book I read this trimester. This book is about the Baudelaire's. They recently just escaped from Count Olaf. Now they think there life is good and normal. They are living with there new guardian professor Montgomery. He is a reptile scientist. He has this room which has tons of reptiles. And the newly discovered reptile. He called it the deadly dangerous snake. It's not really dangerous at all though. Then later Montes get a new assistant. His new assistant is Count Olaf. They are going to go to Peru to look at the new reptiles. Well all I can tell you now is that something bad happens to the Baudelaire's and Monte. Read the book to find out what.||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
" This book was very exciting to read. The end was the most exciting thing. I was not able to feel like I was """"in"""" the book because Lemony Snicket made the things that happened very unrealistic. The main conflict interested me a lot because it had a lot of cliff hangers. The characters did not seem realistic as I stated above. I think the ending to this book was the best one I have read in a long time. If I told you why it would give away what happened I'll just say one word """"surprising""""."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
 The author's voice was in the first person of the Baulderalires. The author's vocabulary was very simple and easy to understand. The author would sometimes go on randomly about something and get sidetracked form the story. The author used a lot of dialogue. But there wasn't even description in the book. The tone of the book was pretty much a monotone but was still very exciting. I think the author should have gotten more excited about some things or put some more things into detail.||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
 I give this book an 8/10 because even though it is one of my favorites it still is not as good as some of the other book in his series. I would defiantly recommend this book but I think you should read the first book so you understand it all.||||||||||||||||||||

Period 5||||||||||||||||||||
"  In this book of the famous series, Klaus, Violet, and Sunny move in to their uncle, Uncle Monty, """"forever."""" Uncle Monty studies snakes. His whole life has been devoted to the study of  snakes worldwide. He has discovered new types of snakes and collected common ones. Hence, he needs a place to keep them all. So, he keeps them in a room called the Reptile Room. Now let's get back to the children. The story starts out very happy for them(which is very unusual). They arrive at their Uncle's MANSION. You heard me, MANSION. He then informs them that they are going on and expedition to Peru. So, they must obviously make preparations. They then study and create provisions in the Reptile Room. All goes well, for about a week. The children are very happy and relaxed. Then the new butler """"Stephano"""" has arrived. The children immediatley recognize him. He is no other than Count Oalf. THe children are terrified and shocked. Their happiness is gone. Later in the book, Uncle Monty is """"accidently"""" killed. They know he was mudered by Count OLaf. Violet secretly opens his suitcase and finds the evidence to find him guilty. They try to send him to jail, but he ends up escaping. That pretty much sums up this book of unfortunate events."||||||||||||||||||||
"  My favorite part of this book is that the author would stop and give a different view of the story, define one of those""""translate in English please"""" definitons, and put in some humor. One quote is """"The word flourish here means a sweeping gesture, often used to show off."""" Another quote is """"Meeka! Sunny said, which probably meant """"Good-bye, Mr. Poe. Thank you for driving us."""" There are so many more quotes than that but I won't list them all here."||||||||||||||||||||
  Some of my least favorite parts were the false leading names. One example of this would be The Incredibly Deadly Viper. It sounds very scary but it isn't. All it does is charge at you and plays with you. It was meant to be a practical joke frome Uncle Monty| but I don't find it to be that humorous.|||||||||||||||||||
"  My favorite part of this book was the part when they found Stephano guilty and proved he was Count Olaf. This lifted their spirits and mine because they suffered so much turmoil and hardships up to this moment. Plus nobody believed them before. Even though he got away, Count Oalf was gone from their lives once again."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

"Having escaped Count Olaf, the Baudeliares are placed with their Uncle Montgomery (""""Uncle Monty""""), a reptile specialist, and the children have a normal life - for a bit.  Until, of course, Count Olaf (in one of his disguses) resumes his attempts at getting the Baudeliare fortune.  Mayhem ensues, with an unhappy ending for some.  Once again the skills of Violet and Klaus (and of course Sunny's teeth) come in handy as they foil Olaf's plots."||||||||||||||||||||

"Again, Snicket cleverly plays with words, inviting the reader to learn and enjoy language with him.  And again there is a strong emphasis on reading and learning - two things near and dear to my heart.  But I had to give it five stars simply because I enjoyed the story so much.

"I consider it my duty to inform you that this horrible gift set contains the first three misrable books in Lemony Snicket's utterly unfortunate book series, """"A Series of Unfortunate Events.""""  For some reason, even though the books describe nothing but sadness and terror, they continue to show up on bestseller lists.  One might wonder why this happens when in the very first chapter of first dreadful book, THE BAD BEGINNING, the Baudeliares recieve word that their parents have perrished in a terrible fire while they spent the day at the beach.  Following this utterly wretched news, their lives don't improve, and they are sent to live with the revoltingly gross and unbelieveably greedy Count Olaf, who attempts to get his fillhy hands on their fortune.  Upon failing, he tries again in THE REPTILE ROOM and THE WIDE WINDOW, when the children are sent to live with two ill-fated guardians, the kind but uncareful Uncle Monty and terrified, weak, grammer-obsessed Aunt Josephine.  In conclusion, if these books even sound fun to read, you are better off seeking medical help than spendinng your money on this boxed set.  In these three books, trouble begins, and in later installments of the series, it only worsens.  Wouldn't you rather read a more pleasnt book?  I know of a supurb one called """"The Littlist Elf,"""" and I highly suggest you read that one instead of these depressing novels."||||||||||||||||||||

Over the last two or three books we've been given tidbits about bigger mysteries surrounding the children and their parents.  In this book the tidbits become much more substantial and give us a clue as to the direction the series might take.  While it may seem that my description is a bit vague| that is because I do not wish to give away any of the surprises in this book| and there is at least one very big surprise for the children and the reader| as well as a number of smaller surprises.|||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
Because of the twists and turns| I am unable to provide the description I normally do for books in this series.  As I noted earlier| there are a lot of surprises.  Those surprises make for one of the most intriguing books in this series.  I am anxiously anticipating the next volume| and even more| the end of the series| when I am hoping that Lemony Snicket will reveal all the mysteries.|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"This particular entry in the series does involve death, again, and in your imagination the death is likely somewhat gruesome.  Fortunately the amount of description given to the death is minimal and is left mostly to the reader's imagination.  Because of several intense moments, and the death, I would recommend this book for children 9 and older, though as always you should know the ability of your child to handle books similar to this one.  This book does have its educational moments, though somewhat muted in comparison to some of the other entries in this series.  Overall, the continued challenge to the paradigm that children's books for the stated age range should be relatively tame along with the creativity of this particular book requires a rating of 5 stars.  This book is yet another solid entry in this series, which just seems to get better and better."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

Where as the first book introduced you to the main characters, Violet, Klaus, Sunny and Count Olaf and simple story setting, this one continues to excite as a few more characters are added. I won't explain the story, seeing there has been more than two hundred reviewers who have reviewed this book, but I will say one thing, """"The Baudelaires continue to stumble in more woeful situations."""" That is, if they can find a way out. But Count Olaf is unpredictable. We already saw his elusiveness throughout the first book.The book has endless meanings of words, seeing that is a good thing for younger readers. That does not wreck the book, but it slows down faster and more older readers. The book does not revolve around violence, even though there is, by the end of the book, a senseless murder(which I won't describe for you for you have to find out for yourself). There is also a terrifying car crash, lying and backstabbing, and a rude repulsive villian, which you'd all expect from a horrible and sad novel. The novel generally fluctuates around the fact the Baudelaires parents are dead which is reminded by Lemony Snicket several times, but it's not the case for the entire series. The books get thicker book by book by book, but you wouldn't expect the Baudelaires parents would be dead while you were reading book 6,7,8,9,10 or 11, would you. There is more information as the books go along."||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
"I'd read this book a long time ago, so I can't explain in detail the story. But one thing I can remember is a page full of """"never""""s when Violet or Klaus(my memory is fuzzy) were fiddling with dangerous electrical appliances.The Baudelaires are smart and difficult to outwit so that's why there are additional volumes in """"A series of unfortunate events"""". Klaus is good for he is good at researching, Violet is good because she can create inventions without the materials needed when in dangerous situations, and Sunny is good at biting(what can you expect of an infant baby?). Sunny's inproper english is hard to understand but lucky we've go Klaus or Violet or even Lemony Snicket to translate. I've read all except the new one, Book 12. The series so far, if your up to """"The Reptile Room"""" or you've just finished reading """"The Reptile Room"""", may have a simple plan or setting, but the books get more complicated with endless layers of clues, riddles, mysterious characters throughout the series, and more members of Count Olaf join. Characters die, or are mistaken to be dead as I've said before. Also, this being not the most influential unfortunate events book, but being a successful book by the name of Lemony Snicket, it could be the most favorite books even though the book isn't as time consuming as the others. It is quite straight forward than the others. Also in """"The Bad Beggining"""" the picture at the end of the book shows a snake on the corner of the street on the picture. """"The Reptile Room"""" deals with snakes."||||||||||||||||||||

The prose is perfect for children. It is easy to read and filled with alliteration. Best of all| this book goes out of its way to teach vocabulary to children. Instead of filling the book with long words (for children) expecting the children to look up the words they didn't understand (which they won't)| it goes out of its way to explain the bigger words.||||||||||||||||||

This is the story of the Baudelaire siblings and continues where the first book left off as they are taken to their Uncle Monty's house to be taken care of.  While they begin to love Uncle Monty and look forward to spending a life with him| another scheme is hatched by Count Olaf to take control of the fortune.  Again the only thing that can help the Baudelaire orphans is their wit| wisdom| and bravery.|||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
You are warned at the beginning of the book| and throughout| that this book does not have a happy ending. It is part right. The book does not have the best ending| but it doesn't have the worst ending either. I'll pick up the other books| but it does appear that this book will not leave you hanging and wishing for a different ending. Actually| I prefer this ending which shows that not everything will go your way which is the norm in life and not the exception. I don't think elementary school aged children are too young to start learning this| if they haven't already.||||||||||||||

While it may seem that my description is a bit vague| that is because I do not wish to give away any of the surprises in this book| and there is at least one very big surprise for the children and the reader| as well as a number of smaller surprises.||||||||||||||||
Because of the twists and turns| I am unable to provide the description I normally do for books in this series.  As I noted earlier| there are a lot of surprises.  Those surprises make for one of the most intriguing books in this series.  I am anxiously anticipating the next volume| and even more| the end of the series| when I am hoping all the mysteries are finally revealed.|||||||||||||||
"This particular entry in the series does involve death, again, and in your imagination the death is likely somewhat gruesome.  Fortunately the amount of description given to the death is minimal, and is left mostly to the reader's imagination.  Because of several intense moments, and the death, I would recommend this book for children 9 and older, though as always you should know the ability of your child to handle books similar to this one.  This book does have its educational moments, though somewhat muted in comparison to some of the other entries in this series.  Overall, the continued challenge to the paradigm that children's books for the stated age range should be relatively tame along with the creativity of this particular book requires a rating of 5 stars.  Another solid entry in this series, which just seems to get better and better."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Carnivorous-Carnival-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064410129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||||

Much tragedy and unfortunate things befall the Baudelaire children| Violet| Klaus| and Sunny. They were on the beach when a family friend| Mr. Poe| told them that their parents had died in the Baudelaire mansion in a fire. Mr. Poe explained that their parents had instructed that the children be put in the care of a relative| and the fortune would remain untouched until Violet was of legal age. It was decided that they were going to stay with Count Olaf| because he was the relative that lived closest to the Baudelaires' home| so he adopted the children. They all hated him from the moment they met him. Count Olaf was planning ways to gain control over the Baudelaire fortune.||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
It is so refreshing to find an author who is funny without assuming that kids need potty jokes to laugh. The humor is dark| twisted| and hilarious.  While the Baudelaire Orphan's series are written for children| they can still be appreciated by mature readers. You truly root for Violet| Klaus| and Sonny and feel sadness and anger over their plight. Count Olaf is truly a degenerate villain for whom nothing is too extreme even murdering a child. Very few villains can be so simply crafted yet inspire such revulsion from the reader. Oddly enough this is a feat rarely accomplished by other more widely recognized by the public.|||||||||||||||

  My favorite part in this book was when Sunny was bit by a snake. He was bitten by a snake in the reptile room. the snakes name was the deadly viper. But the deadly viper is and a venomous snake so that was a funny and sad point at a time.||||||||||||||||||||

Count Olaf is as 'dashing' as ever(aka horrible, smelly, awful, gross, ugly and mean as ever). Very funny, one of the most humorous! And guess what?
