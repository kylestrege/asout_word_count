The last book left you hanging at the end of which this book begins. This book continues from where Sunny was in Olaf's clutches and Violet and Klaus are rolling down a mountain to a conceivable death. In this book along with long awaited answers to questions, we are joined by past book characters and characters we've only heard about. I loved how we got move insight on the VFD and more clues. This book also brought in information from the previous books, which was good because it tied the series together more. So if you haven't read the series from the beginning then you should so you don't get lost.I'm hoping that the last 3 books have this same build up to the long awaited finale of the 13th book."|||||||||||

Yes it is true-a very heartbreaking thing indeed!  Sunny, the youngest, sharp-toothed Baudelaire is with Olaf and his nasty crew.  Violet and Klaus are rolling down the Mortmain(I believe) Mountains and trying to come up with a way to stop.  The famed ribbon has been in the picture for quiet a while so Violet is already thinking up some kind of strange and creative invention.  They decide to use some very sticky substances from the trailor they are in.  Since most of you know about the sequel it is safe to say that the """"invention"""" worked."|||||||||||

  Sunny| as I said before| is with Olaf and his troupe.  She has to do everything for the lazy bunch including cooking with very sparse materials.  But Sunny manages with her cooking talents and newfound maturity(our little Sunny can even speak almost as a normal person would!).  But still Sunny is very far from appreciated.|||||||||

The three protagonists Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire, are separated leaving Violet and Klaus to their doom. Throughout the book the Baudelaires manage to: Lose Sunny to the antagonist Count Olaf, escape a speeding wagon, get chased by snow nats, find fire and shelter, run into a rather cruel and familiar enemy, meet a VFD member, get to the VFD hideout to find it  eliminated, reach Sunny, get caught by Olaf, figure out his plan... And after all this nearly nothing is accomplished. The Baudelaires may have reached one goal and that was to be reunited. But VFD and their parents still remain a mystery."|||||||||||
  The book definitely has a lot of character| with Count Olaf and his troop and the Baudelaires| but it is mostly plot. With Count Olaf always scheming something to get hold of the Baudelaire fortune| the Baudelaires always trying to outwit him and especially in this book with the Baudelaires trying to find out the mystery of VFD.||||||||
"  Personally this is one of the best books I've ever read because of how fun the writing is. Lemony Snicket has the funniest, oddest most entertaining writing there is. And he chooses to be a little more adventurous in this book by giving Violet, Sunny and Klaus the most difficult situations in the series. Anyone who reads this book must read the other nine in the series, because many of the mysteries in the series are uncovered in this book. Although just enough is hidden that there is still much suspense and thirst to read the next book in the series."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Slippery-Slope-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||

Having disguised themselves as Carnival Freaks and pretending to join Count Olaf's gang in order to get to the VFD headquarters, the Baudelaire Orphans have been discovered by Count Olaf and while Sunny was kidnapped, Klaus and Violet or locked in a trailer and are rolling backwards down a mountain road with no control over the trailer. This is where we begin The Slippery Slope. The elder orphans struggle to find a way to save themselves and then make their way back up the mountain to the secret headquarters, and Sunny struggles to find an opportunity to escape to find her siblings or to learn more about the scheme of Count Olaf."|||||||||||
|||||||||||
As always| one book in this series is quite similar to the others| but we learn much more about the mysterious VFD that has been hinted at for several books now and somewhat more about the Quagmire Triplets is also revealed. One gets the sense that Snicket truly is wrapping this series up and leading towards an end (not to mention that book 13 is called The End). The Slippery Slope is a satisfying book and one which should please longtime readers of the series. The fun| the despair| the words of warning| the riddles and rhymes| and the new mysterious about the old villains...all of this is included. If you like the first nine| you'll be happy with ten.||||

This book will be included in the third season of the Netflix television series."|||||||||||
|||||||||||
The book begins immediately after the end of The Carnivorous Carnival with Violet and Klaus in a runaway caravan barreling down the steep mountainside with Sunny a prisoner of Count Olaf and his cohorts. And while it is narratively certain that the two siblings will escape their perilous fate (or there wouldn't be much of a book)| I'll leave the details for you to discover once you read the book. It's totally worth it| believe me.|||||||||
|||||||||||
The rest of the book has the Baudelaires separate as Violet and Klaus try to make their way to Count Olaf and thus to Sunny.  The two encounter a group of Snow Scouts that happens to include the rather obnoxious Carmelita Spats that we had last encountered in The Austere Academy. They're not the sort of help you'd expect to find but it turns out one of the scouts is more than he seems. Meanwhile Count Olaf is already at the peak of Mount Fraught preparing for a plan of his own with poor Sunny being forced to prepare meals for them despite her age.|||||||||||
|||||||||||
What I Liked: This book finally begins to answer some of the V.F.D. questions that I've had for quite some time now and we get a better look at things at to some degree a limited understanding of what those letters really mean. Brilliantly (and infuriatingly) V.F.D. turns out to stand for a great many things and thus perhaps all V.F.D. definitions are somehow relavant to the central mystery of the series.|||||||||||
|||||||||||
And the book has a larger theme of growing up| something that somewhat began when Klaus remembered it was his birthday during The Vile Village and better realized here. This is brought into focus for Sunny who is left without one of her siblings to help her for the first time in a while and this forces a bit of growing up indeed in order to find a way to keep ahead of Count Olaf. And you really appreciate that well deserved character moment in the context of everything else that had occurred.||||||||||
|||||||||||
What Could Have Been Better: I'm not quite sure why Snicket decided to bring back Carmelita Spats here if only because she was successful at being a very annoying character maybe? She was one of the more memorable aspects to The Austere Academy but that didn't mean she was worth the return. But here she is with the scouts and this acts as a setup for other characters coming back in the remaining books of the series.|||||||||||
|||||||||||
I'm not sure what the point of expanding Count Olaf's troupe with the circus freaks while not really commenting on the members of the troupe that had been left behind in past misadventures. While we don't really get a lot of time with them across the books| there used to be a bit of a consistency with how they were described before things started to change. But hey| this book is all about growing out of the old and adopting the new and things do shift around quite a bit.|||||||||
|||||||||||
"TL;DR: The Slippery Slope is a great chapter in the larger saga of the Baudelaries and the mystery of V.F.D. But even as the Baudelaires make some headway forward, this does not mean Count Olaf and those forces allied with him are idle and this growing darkness certainly helps shape the larger story."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Slippery-Slope-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||

|||||||||||
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE begins immediately after the conclusion of Book #9| THE CARNIVOROUS CARNIVAL.  The events that happened there were so horrible.  When we meet up with the Baudelaires| Violet and Klaus are rushing down the slope of a mountain in a runaway caravan that was accelerating with every passing second.  Meanwhile| Sunny is being held captive by Count Olaf and his ever growing troupe.  Oh| those poor children!|||||||
|||||||||||
First Violent and Klaus have to figure out how to slow the caravan and prevent themselves from being smashed into hundreds of little fragments.  Only then are they able to climb back up the mountain and rescue Sunny from the clutches of Olaf and crew.|||||||||||
|||||||||||
Surprisingly as it might seem| Sunny isn't in too much danger.  She's useful around the camp and since Olaf and his troupe don't think she is able to eavesdrop and learn important information.||||||||||
|||||||||||
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is a very important book in the chronicles of the Baudelaires.  New characters are introduced| old characters are re-met| and small mysteries are solved.  When I read this story it felt to me like it was the beginning of the end of the saga.  With only three books left in the series it very well should be.  But| THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is just as exciting and dangerous as the previous books in the series.  By the end of the story everyone learns an important lesson: once you fall down a slippery slope| it's very hard to get back up again and the only place to go is down.|||||||

Speaking of which| I think I shall retire to rest my bum from the fall I had on the ice yesterday.||||||||||

Hilarious!' when they described the books. True, the books were funny. But the main plot was that Daniel Handler was sick of happy endings, and created these wonderfully odd and engaging stories. In the latest book, it comes as close as possible to the quote above (which I am paraphrasing from an actual summary) as possible. You've got all the classics: vocabulary lessons, sadness, mystery (combined with the unauthorized autiobiography, you can spend hours analysing the series-but you still can be surprised, I was utterly shocked at a not-so-new character that appeared), and yes I admit it, there is a lot of humor. I particularily liked the part about the strawberry-crazed, stick-carrying maniac *laughs*"|||||||||||
But there is also some new stuff. The book deals with some serious issues (and I don't mean dark issues like death| that has been around since book one) like the worries that the Baudelaire's had of them being villains| or that fact that Sunny is more grown up| that make for an interesting read that makes you think and is somehow sadder then the normal unluckiness of the Baudelaires.  This is the first book in which the Baudelaire's are seperated and (as cliched and oxymoron like as this sounds| I normally loathe to do oxymorons) it is both sadder then most books yet lightened by more humor. (This is probably due to the fact that the book is over 300 pages long| but any Lemony Snicket or Harry Potter fan will be able to zip through and still want to log online and chat about the new clues you have found out. There are also some new characters (SPOILER! Even a romance in which Lemony tortures his fans by choosing just then to 'give Violet some privacy' >:( :P END OF SPOILER!)| old favorites| and a lot of new information on VFD.||||
"All in all, this is a great book with both humor and sadness and tantalising clues about VFD, and I highly recommend it to both Lemony Snicket fans and people who just want to know if the books are as good as people say they are. (hint: they are, although I imagine that some people may find them a bit repetative-I don't, but some people might) I'm already wating eagerly for the next book."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Slippery-Slope-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||

"We encounter more VFDs here: Very Fascinating Drama; Very Fun Day; Vinegar-Flavored Doughnuts; Violent Frozen Dragonflies; Voracious Fierce Dragon; Vain Fat Dictator; Vernacularly Fastened Door; Vertical Flame Diversion; Verdant Flammable Device; and Volunteer Feline Detective, amongst others. We also encounter a most odiferous young girl who fashions herself the False Spring Queen of the Snow Scouts at this particular juncture - Carmelita Spats - whom I have always envisioned as that large brute of a girl that used to beat up on Lisa Simpson. As horrid as she is, it is fun to have the word """"cakesniffer"""" bandied around again."|||||||||||

"Sunny has really beefed up her skills as a chef. Having been abducted by Count Olaf, she is separated from her siblings and has been forced into performing chores for Count Olaf that are nearly impossible for a child her age. Not to mention that every night, at the top of a very cold mountain, she is forced to sleep in a casserole dish! Sunny's culinary abilities are beginning to blossom. One of the many creative dishes she fashions out of the seemingly incompatible ingredients that the filthy Olaf has left in the even filthier trunk of his automobile is Lox. To prepare Lox, one most have the appropriate accoutrements - or so says Snicket, in a rare misuse of a word. Accoutrements have more to do with apparel than ingredients in food, but with a stretch of the imagination, it's not difficult to forgive. Anyway, Sunny somehow finds """"bagels, cream cheese, sliced cucumber, black pepper, and capers"""". She's also lucky enough to have salmon at her disposal, and she smokes this in preparation for making the Lox. (Not smoke in the sense of smoking a cigarette of course, or a Verdant Flammable Device,  but smoke in the sense of sending out distress signals to her siblings!)"|||||||||||

The term 'shipping', for those who do not know, is when people pair up fictional characters because they think they would make good couples. I am a loyal Violet/Duncan shipper and always will be, and in this book, my hopes for that shipping were almost completely destroyed. Some people may think shipping is either amusing or rather foolish, so I'm not going to base my whole review based on that one moment in the book, especially since this book had a lot to offer, and because I believe in rating books fairly, so."|||||||||||

The Slippery Slope reveals many secrets| the biggest of which might be what V.F.D. stands for and what V.F.D. is. This book starts out much| much quicker than any of the others| that's for sure. Violet and Klaus are stuck in a caravan rolling downhill| almost about to slide off the mountain edge. Sunny is in Count Olaf's clutches.|||||||
|||||||||||
I suppose I could say that the entire plot of this book is based around Violet and Klaus climbing up and down the Valley of Four Drafts trying to rescue Sunny| but I would be dead wrong. Sunny's purpose is actually used as a spy. She finds out about the last safe place of V.F.D. being Hotel Denouement. We also see the Snicket File in this book| and you'll have to read the story to figure out what side gets it| hehehe. Also| some old characters such as the beloved Carmelita Spats are brought back to the storyline in this book.|||||||

After countless tantalizing hints and suggestions| we finally get some real clues. Without giving anything important away| I can reveal that information is uncovered concerning whether or not both Baudelaire Parents really died in book one's fatal fire (hinted at in the last book); we draw much closer to finding out what the initials V.F.D. mean; we are reacquainted with at least two characters from the early books; and a hitherto missing person makes an astonishing appearance subsequently shedding considerable light on the tragic events blighting the Baudelaire sibling's lives. Furthermore| although you won't be able to read about it (for reasons of privacy)| Violet has an unexpected romantic entanglement in a very cold place!|||||||
|||||||||||
The last book left readers with a cliff-hanger: Sunny had been abducted by Count Olaf and his entourage and was being driven uphill| whilst Violet and Klaus were rolling downhill in an out-of-control carnival caravan. If that sounds bad ... then be warned ... things get much worse! If you enjoy cheerful books about mischievous elves| talking mice| magical spells and soft| fluffy teddy bears| then don't order this book - however| if you like alphabetical pledges| snow gnats| trained eagles| mysterious hidden letters| and find vicarious pleasure in the misfortunes of others (an expression which here means you like laughing at luckless orphans)| then this is the book for you.

It's a genuinely touching and emotional moment, and it's to Daniel Handler's credit (the real author behind Snicket) that such a goofy, macabre series is still capable of such great moments that are anchored in our attachment to these characters. But there's a lot more to be had in Slippery Slope, from a reminder that Sunny Baudelaire is growing up to the arrival of a fairly surprising character, from glimpses into what exactly V.F.D. is to a realization that Count Olaf may not be the only villain out these these days. And, of course, Snicket does all this while still telling a story that's exciting, laugh-out-loud funny, and manages to both develop his complex mythology and deepen the themes and ideas that he's been playing with all along. Key among those: what, exactly, makes someone a villain? And at what point is crossing that line appropriate? It's a difficult question, and it's to the series' credit that it doesn't offer cheap or easy answers. Instead, it ends every bit as conflicted and unsure as its characters, and there's something refreshing in that honesty and refusal to condescend to its audience, no matter how young they might be. The cliffhangers at the end of each book are getting harder to walk away from, but even if they weren't, it would be hard to walk away from the Snicket books at this point - not when we've gone from laughing with the series to being genuinely and honestly moved by what it has to offer."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Slippery-Slope-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||

R. Bird,Slip sliding away,11-Oct-04,""It's hard to believe that just ten depressing books ago the Baudelaire orphans were living their lives without any idea of where their journeys might end.  They didn't know anything about a mysterious organization called VFD, or suspect the source of the fire that killed their parents.  They were clueless as to where Count Olaf got his information about the orphans' whereabouts, and they'd have been completely baffled if you told them that the eye on Olaf's ankle was more than it seemed.  But with """"The Slippery Slope"""" the Baudelaires are wiser, if not happier.  Sure they've used their intelligence and resources to get out of multiple sticky nefarious situations.  Yet with this particular offering, the siblings are facing something they've never encountered to this extent before.  They've been split apart from one another.  It's distressing."|||||||||||
|||||||||||
Far more distressing is the fact that while Sunny has been purloined by Olaf and his creepy crew| Klaus and Violet have been sent down a steep mountain path towards their doom.  After surviving (all thanks to Violet's clear head) the two decide to rescue their baby sister.  Along the way they run into someone they've long since thought dead| and discover a host of information about VFD (though not what it stands for).  Sunny| on her part| becomes a thoroughly resourceful Baudelaire in her own right.  Having been exhausted as a character of her tendency towards biting| Sunny suddenly appears to also be a very clever cook.  This is for the best since Olaf & Co. have decided to use her for all their menial and craft services.  Most babies would balk.  This one's up to the challenge.  And though the ending is| in its way| depressing| it's a bit more cheery than some of the situations faced throughout this text.|||
|||||||||||
"The author of this book has done a magnificent job detailing the orphans' moral struggles as well.  Having helped the malicious Count Olaf to set the Caligari Carnival on fire in the last book, Klaus and Violet must consider just how much they can be held responsible for their actions.  They've still never really come to terms with the idea of burning stuff up like Olaf, and now the phrase, """"Fight fire with fire"""", has caused them a great deal of concern as well.  Is it possible to defeat Olaf without lowering themselves to his level?  Just how wrong is it of them to set traps like he does?  And are they actually villains after having helped a villain, or are they victims?  This is heavy stuff for any children's book to handle.  I wouldn't be particularly surprised if kids reading this novella huff a little in exasperation over the orphans' moral qualms.  After all, they've obviously been victimized numerous times.  Still, if the author can convince kids that retaliating against evil with evil is a ridiculous notion, he's done more good than he probably intended."|||||||||||
|||||||||||
"But that's neither here nor there.  The point is that """"The Slippery Slope"""" is a fine, magnificent, deeply depressing tale that more that deserves to be placed in the overall orphan oeuvre.  The Baudelaires often complain that as time goes by their investigations churn up more questions than answers.  With three books following this one in the series, it's unlikely that this pattern will abate any time soon.  Until then, we'll just have to read each and every Baudelairian adventure be they high or low.  I for one, am delighted with the prospect.

The siblings are orphaned in the first book in the series: as they are later informed by the apparently well-meaning but ineffectual Mr. Poe, the executor of their parents' considerable estate, a terrible fire consumes the children's home one day while they are off at the beach. The circumstances of the fire are, one must conclude, highly suspicious."|||||||||||
|||||||||||
"Mr. Poe's efforts to place the siblings with a guardian land them first in the squalid home of a distant relative, a uni-browed actor by the name of Count Olaf, who begins scheming at once to make off with the Baudelaire fortune. Olaf's villainous activity continues throughout the series and very often involves his employment of outlandish disguises which no one but the Baudelaires is capable of seeing through. (""""Some people called this man wicked. Some called him facinorous, which is a fancy word for 'wicked.' But everyone called him Count Olaf, unless he was wearing one of his ridiculous disguises and making people call him a false name."""") As Olaf's girlfriend puts it in The Slippery Slope, """"money and personal satisfaction"""" make Olaf's relentless efforts to seize the Baudelaires' fortune worth the trouble: """"Once we have our hands on the Baudelaire fortune, we'll have enough money to live a life of luxury and plan several more treacherous schemes!"""""|||||||||||
|||||||||||
"Olaf's villainy is a constant throughout the series, and so is the author's linguistic playfulness--his clever aphorisms (""""Taking one's chances is like taking a bath, because sometimes you end up feeling comfortable and warm, and sometimes there is something terrible lurking around that you cannot see until it is too late and you can do nothing  else but scream and cling to a plastic duck"""") ; his amusing verbal tics (""""a phrase which here means...""""). There are also hints throughout the series about the enigmatic, rarely photographed Snicket's curious life. References to his """"pulling aside a bearskin rug in order to access a hidden trapdoor in the floor"""", for example, or to spending months on a mountain with """"only a lantern and a rhyming dictionary for company"""" slip into the narrative. Snicket is evidently on the run--from whom it is not clear--and so he wisely employs as his legal, literary, and social representative a certain Daniel Handler, who is himself, as coincidence would have it, the author of novels for adults."|||||||||||
|||||||||||
"I should confess that I am half in love with Mr. Snicket, and I would pledge myself to him eternally were it not for a previous commitment of my own and Lemony's apparent devotion to the deceased Beatrice, to whom he dedicates each of his books (for example, """"To Beatrice--darling, dearest, dead""""). But I *can* pledge myself to the task of promoting his research into the Baudelaires' lives, and urge you to buy Snicket's books, however filled with horrors they may be, and however much your possession of them may imperil you."|||||||||||

Only this time, Sunny is trapped in the clenches of the enemy and Violet and Klaus must escape a runaway trailer to save her and also find the mysterious headquarters of V.F.D. before Count Olaf does."|||||||||||
  This book takes place in the Mortmain Mountains where the V.F.D. headquarters is to be located. As always| Violet thinks up outrageous inventions to get them out of troubles way. Sunny on the other hand is as close to danger as she could be. After having to endure villain bad breath| sleeping in a casserole bowl| making meals and clean dishes in the snow| Sunny finds one thing that helps her endure all of this.... No one can understand what she saids. This very thing is what keeps her going| that and the hope that her siblings are all right.||||||
This book is more based around Sunny and her actions| with a little bit of Violet and Klaus taking up the rear. Though| Violet and Klaus do have their moments here and there. And... What's this? Has Violet fallen for a boy they met on the way up the mountain?? ;) *Gasp*|||||||||
 Two new characters are introduced into the story| though Snicket doesn't name them for certain reasons unknown. When these two people show up| Sunny notices something| Count Olaf's almost... Afraid of them??? *Deeper Gasp! *  Whoever these 2 mysterious people are; they carry with them the Snicket file. (DUN Dun dunnnnn)||||||||
"  I enjoyed this book very much, seeing as this is the only book series I read besides Harry Potter. I laughed, I cried, I laughed, and I yelled, """"DON'T GO TOWARD THEM YOU FOOLS!"""" and I even mumbled under my breath as I read this touching/horrifying chapter of the orphans adventure."|||||||||||
 I believe this book would appeal to anyone who's read Harry Potter or likes to read something a little different from: They lived happily ever after.|||||||||||
" So I'll end this with the following questions to rattle around in little brains: Can Sunny over hear Count Olaf and discover the truth? Will Violet and Klaus find the secret of V.F.D? And.... How can a bunch of birds carry about 20 or 30 children and a couple adults... in a net?"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Slippery-Slope-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||
