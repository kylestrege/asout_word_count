And THE AUSTERE ACADEMY was a pleasant """"Welcome Back!"""" to the extremely unpleasant lives of the Baudelaires."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"THE AUSTERE ACADEMY is suprisingly the tamest of the first five books; the word """"tame"""", here means (Sorry, I just couldn't resist putting it this way) a little less violence and a bit less sinisterity from the Baudelaire's arch-nemesis, Count Olaf.  However, to balance it out, Mr. Snicket introduces us to someone almost as wicked: Vice Principle Nero (who strives to be as evil as the ruthless emperor he was named after).  Also in the story, the Baudelaires finally encounter some allies.  And perhaps best of all, Mr. Snicket finally gives the reader the first few clues in the vast mystery of The Series of Unfortunate Events."||||||||||||

Possibly the best in the series.,21-Aug-02,""Some may feel that A Series of Unfortunate Events is a little too dark and depressing for younger readers, or for people with a tendency to melancholia in the first place. But I beg to differ - I find the series very inspiring, actually. The Baudelaire orphans are amazingly moving in the way they stick together against all odds and in the face of such adversity, and book five, The Austere Academy, might be the best proof of this."||||||||||||
This book is set in a school| which already brings it closer to the hearts of many schoolgoing readers. In addition to the Baudelaires' other problems they also have to contend with the social problems that every kid has encountered: how to fit in| and make friends with the other children. Here| we see the introduction of the most enduring ray of hope yet for the Baudelaires: the Quagmire triplets. The story of the Baudelaires and their misfortune is first-rate in The Austere Academy| as always| but this book is my personal favourite of the series because it has heart. The friendship forged between the Baudelaires and Quagmires is extremely touching and it also lends an added dimension to the storyline.|||||||

A review by Becki Engstrom| May 8|2004||||||||||
In his 6th book| The Ersatz Elevator| Lemony Snicket continues to chronicle the tragic events of the three close siblings| Violet| Klaus| and the baby| Sunny.  Once again| the Baudelaires face evil and must rely on one another to survive.|||||
"This is a very sad, but humorous, tale of adventure.  In the words of the author, """"there is nothing to be found in these pages but misery, despair, and discomfort, and you still have time to choose something else to read"""".  (Back cover)"||||||||||||
However| I have endured the tragic adventures of the Baudelaire orphans since the first book; where the Baudelaires lost their parents and home in a fire.  I have come to adore the three children| and| so I chose to further read about them.|||||||||
The Baudelaires make a very creative team.  Violet is the inventor| Klaus is the researcher| and Baby Sunny| well she just likes to bite things-anything!  The orphans continuously run into trouble that involve the evil Count Olaf| whom has been after their fortune since the first book.  With the orphans' creativity| they can sometimes escape this evil man.|||||||
"Lemony Snicket writes with a narrator's """"voice"""" when describing the lives of the Baudelaires.  He's very concerned about what he must report to the public as you can """"hear"""" the concern as you read.  Plus, there is no need for a dictionary; the author will define a questionable term as he writes.  For example, """"Violet said, ... `But they [fire tongs] still might come in handy for something.  We don't know what we'll encounter in that hallway, and I don't want to come up shorthanded...'  `Shorthanded' is a word which here means `unprepared', and Violet was thinking that three children alone in a dark hallway holding fire tongs were perhaps a bit more prepared than three children alone in a dark hallway with nothing at all."""" (Pg. 201)"||||||||||||

The orphans have been trying to get away from Count Olaf ever since their parents died in a fire.  Everywhere they have gone Olaf has been able to find them and kill their guardians.  He has found the orphans once more at Prufrock Preparatory School as Coach Genghis.  Coach Genghis makes the orphans go through nights of running as part of his program S.O.R.E.  On top of worrying about Count Olaf the orphans live in """"the orphans shack"""" where tiny crabs are everywhere, fungus juice drips everywhere and there are only bales of hay to sleep on.  Violet, Sunny and Klaus do meet two friends who help them with all of their problems.  Isadora and Duncan Quagmire are orphans that have the answer to almost anything.  The two help the Baudelaires' deal with the snob Carmelita Spats.  In Carmelita's mind the Baudelaires and Quagmires' are cakesniffers.  Sunny, the baby of the family, works in the Administrative building as a secretary.  Violet and Klaus are schooled by teacher who are obsessed with measuring, telling stories and eating bananas.  Principal Nero was a weak character in the book.  The book only talked about him and his violin.  Or him mimicking or punishing someone.  I felt that he could have been more worried about the Baudelaires' safety instead of his six hour performances he did every night.  The Baudelaires' bond with each other and the Quagmires was strong.  Violet, Sunny and Klaus are able to share their emotions with each other.  It's like they have one mind.  From one look in the eye the three knew what to do.  The Quagmires were willing to risk their own life to help Violet, Sunny and Klaus.  They shared their silverware with the Baudelaires' when the Baudelaires' was taken away.  I recommend this book to anybody 10 years or older.  Before reading this book read the first four because they are fun filled and have information needed in order to understand this one."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Mostly because it introduces the Quagmire triplets, setting the scene for something larger in the following books.

Mr Poe, their financial caretaker until Violet finally come to an age to the Baudelaire's fortune, have arranged them to attend Prufrock Preparatory School to further their studies."||||||||||||

The thought of being able to attend Prufrock Preparatory School would normally be ecstatic for the kids but upon their arrival| their miseries seems to be endless. They have an annoying Vice Principal Nero who are pretty irked off kids and insisted on every student to obey ridiculous rules that result with more ridiculous consequences if anybody would break it. Mandotary attendance to his 6 hour nightly recital was another thorn in their lives as he wasn't that good either. Instead of living in a comfortable living quarters| they are assigned to an uncomfortable shack with crabs and mosses| where Nero would call the Orphan Shack.|||||||||

But in the midst of attending such an austere facility| they have a spark of hope when they meet Duncan & Isadora Quagmire| another set of orphans in the school| they new kind friends.|||||||||

Of course that part of relieve isn't that comfortable enough| when they have to attend classes that teaches them nonsense syllabus and Count Olaf is in the corner| in the disguise of being a gym teacher called Genghis| and this time acted in such a way that would really take them off guard.|||||||||

I'm just so lucky as a mellenial to have been born during one. I'm 24 but I remember my mother reading these to me every night after coming home from dinner and how we'd just get so lost in Lemony's whimsical imagination. I was around seven or eight- yes kids it's been out that long- when my mother and I stopped at lucky smells lumber mill but somehow never really got around to AustreAcademy. I am SO GLAD Netflix picked up these series of unfortunate gems because when the movie version came about, of course, Hollywood had to whitewash the crap out of it; cram all four books into a half hour s)$:& show. Sure Jim Carey was a wise choice AT THAT TIME but the guy who played Klaus' acting was as dull and wooden as January Jones. Even at eleven years old I wasn't surprised at all when it tanked. Thank god for Netflix!! Never in my life have I watched a tv adapted novel that makes me now want to read the whole series all over again. Now to head to the library and find AustreAcademy! The casting, directing, screenwriting, and acting is FLAWLESS. they left nothing to chance and nothing changed except sneaking in current political and Sociological events as a means to stay fluent with the times-which was a genius touch by the by.  All I have to say is if you enjoyed the tv version then your gonna love the rest of these books before season two gets released! I promise you! It just goes to show you future TelePlay writers, sometimes going by the book is not always a bad move. What an interesting time these books have been unearthed during... Coincidence?

Violet, the oldest, is waiting to inherit the fortune while a banker named Mr. Poe holding it for them. After their last legall gaurdian had been murdered by Count Olaf, Mr. Poe is taking them to another gaurdian in a small town called Palltryville. Violet, an inventor, is the oldest Baudelaire who takes care of her two siblings. Claus, the second oldest, is a researcher and the only boy between the three children. The third and youngest sibling is a baby who's hobby is to bite things. They all glumly went to Paltryville, expecting more unfortunate events, usually worse then before."||||||||||||
"  When the children got to Paltryville, they found themselves in front of a sign that read """"Lucky Smells Lumbermill"""", and their gaurdian owned the Lumbermill. HE perferred hois name as Mr. Sir, and he had a buisness partner named Charles, who was very nice. The three children were to work there, and their first work-day there was horrible. They were waken up early in the morning by a man in a surgeon mask, and he ordered all the workers there. By the end of the day, The children were exhausted after working from dawn to dusk with a peice of gum for lunch. For their salary, they got paid coupons to hospitals, markets, shops, and many other places."||||||||||||
  The next day| as they went to work| the masked man tripped Claus| and his glasses broke. He went away to the optomist| and he came back at midnight. He strangely obeyed every command like a zombie. The next day| he destroyed a machine on accident| and he suddenly came back to his senses. The masked man insantly tripped him again after blaming him for the damage.Claus's glasses broke once more| and he was sent to the optomist again| this time with his two sisters who insisted on going with him. On the way there| they figured out that Claus had been hypnotized. He was hypnotized once more| and Violet read a book that said that you could unhypnotized someone by saying a certain word outloud. Violet found out the word and unhypnotized him| just as Mr. Sir came in and saw what was happening| and he called Mr Poe.
  They found Count Alof duisguised as Sharon| a receptionist for the optomist| who was also working with Count Alof. They also found out that the masked man was one of Count Alof's assistants. They unfortuneantly managed to escape| and The children and everybody else sadly watched them go.|||||||||
"  I think that this book is unhappily humorous, and it is very mysterious. You always and constantly want to know what happens next, and it is somehow funny, altough the three children are treated badly. The whole series all have a bad ending, and Count Alof always escapes."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

When we last left the poor Baudelaire triplets| they had once again escaped from the clutches of evil Count Olaf| though they had witnessed a gruesome accidental death at the Lucky Smells Lumber Mill.  Unable to find a relative to look after the children| Mr. Poe finds a boarding school that will take all three of the orphans in:  Prufrock Preparatory School.  The Baudelaire's are at first hopeful.  After all| they've never been to a boarding school before.  But their optimism soon disappears.||||||||
||||||||||||
The school is run by Vice Principal Nero and he forces the children to sit through dreadful violin recitals.  The children are forced to live in a tiny shack filled with crabs and dripping fungus.  And to make things worse their new P.E. teacher is none other| than Count Olaf himself.  Oh dear!|||||||||||
||||||||||||
Yet| there is some less-sad news| at the austere academy the Baudelaire's meet and befriend the two Quagmire triplets.  The two sets of children discover they have a lot in common (did you know that both their homes were destroyed by a fire and both sets of parents were killed in the fire that destroyed their homes). But what happens to the Quagmire triplets| oh it's too dreadful to reveal here.  If you want to find out more you'll have to read it yourself.|||||||||

It is about three Baudelaire orphans who are going to another foster home because there is misery that follows them wherever they go. There are three children are: Violet (the oldest who is fourteen), Klaus (the second child who is twelve), and Sunny (the youngest child who was just an infant). They are orphans because their parents died in a fire. Their parents left them a lot of fortune, known as the """"Baudelaire Fortune"""" and a man named Count Olaf tries to steal it and he and the children barely escape every time (Count Olaf doesn't go to jail and the children escape from Count Olaf). If he can't get it he gets his assistants to steal it and they go as disguise. While the children were going in a train with Mr. Poe (the banker) they saw a building that was shaped like the eyes of Count Olaf. They were entering the town called Paltryville and they were to work at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill because their foster parent was the owner of the Company with a partner called Charles and they were to call their foster parent """"Sir."""" Then one day a man that woke them up called Foreman Flacutono was acting strange, later on the day he purposely tripped Klaus, and since he has glasses they broke. So Charles took him to the eye shaped building and he came to the dormitory very late and both Violet and Sunny were worried to sick since they went to the library that Charles made and a book there that had the same eyes were written by the doctor there, Dr. Georgina Orwell. So Violet suspected something and went back to the library and researched for the whole night without any sleep and found out that they hypnotized Klaus and then the next day Foreman Flacutono tripped him again then he went back to Dr. Orwell's office and Charles said that he would take Klaus, but Violet insisted that she take him. When they went inside the building Dr. Orwell came out and greeted them kindly and Violet wondered what had happened. Then inside her accountant said that she was Shirley but was really Count Olaf and later on he Violet proved that he was and so they called Mr. Poe and let him take the children to a new foster home."||||||||||||
" I liked the book The Miserable Mill because it was very interesting. It kept me to keep reading and reading. When I read the book I felt sorry for the Baudelaire orphans and how lucky it was to have parents. """"And so it was as if Violet and Sunny Baudelaire stared at Count Olaf- or, as the nameplate on his desk said, Shirley."""" This part of the book told me immediately that this was Count Olaf. This part of the book made me scared and also anxious of what was going to happen next!"||||||||||||
" I also enjoyed reading The Miserable Mill because it was mysterious. Since it was mysterious it made me wonder and also made me curious of what was going to happen next. """"""""And you're in cahoots with Dr. Orwell!"""" Violet said, using a phrase which here means """"working with, in order to capture the Baudelaire fortune."""" """"Aren't you?"""""""" This phrase got me very freaked out because it kept making me wonder if the Baudelaire orphans were going to get robbed by Count Olaf."||||||||||||
" My favorite part in The Miserable Mill was when the Baudelaire orphans were in the eye shaped building with Shirley (otherwise known as Count Olaf) and Dr. Orwell. It made me think that the two adults were going to kidnap the orphans to steal their fortune. I also thought that they were going to hurt Klaus when they took him inside to get his new glasses. If I was either Violet or Sunny I would too be worried because I would wonder if my brother was going to survive or not.  When Violet refused to take a cookie from Shirley I knew that refusing was the best thing to do because it could have had poison in it. The Miserable Mill is an interesting book and everyone should read it too!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

The sibling find themselves in another most unfortunate situation as they are forced to work by sir at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill which he owns. However the most horrible thing is they only get a piece of gum for lunch and the head foreman , Foreman Flacutono is a grumpy and mean man. Much to their horror they have to sleep in damp wet conditions and only get one bunk between the three of them. However things get much worse when Klaus breaks his glasses and has to go to Dr. Orwell to repair them. When he returns Violet and Sunny can tell he isn't himself. When they investigate they find out that the nasty Count Olaf is disguised as Shirley a receptionist at Dr. Orwells.

Anyway, in this book, the Baudelaires are sent to Paltryville to work at the Lucky Smells lumber mill; which is owned by a man with a cloud of smoke where his head should be along with his friendly partner, Charles. The main dormitory, a windowless building with faux windows drawn on the walls, is where all the workers live. Forman Flacutono is in charge with is two pots that he clangs together. As the Baudelaires work strenuously at the mill, they encounter a bad casserole, some sticks of gum, an understocked library, a hopnotist, a terrible accident, and Shirley.

"I first came to this series after watching the tie-in movie """"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"""". I love the series for its superb characterization, lovely writing, quirky plotlines, and deeply dark humor. This fifth book in the series carries on the tradition and will not disappoint fans."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"Like the rest of the novels in this series, this book is very slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all, it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However, the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in their new """"home"""" as students in the dreadful Prufrock Preparatory School. The schooling is boring and unhelpful, and the mandatory violin concerts every night are shrieky and terrible, but maybe the school security system can finally keep Count Olaf away."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"A note about the audiobook edition of this book: like the previous book (""""The Miserable Mill""""), this installment in the series is narrated by """"Lemony Snicket"""" (who in this case I assume is the author, Handler). Handler is a superb writer, but his narration is a little jarring after the smooth tones of Tim Curry's previous narration (of """"The Bad Beginning"""" and """"The Reptile Room""""). The overall narration is still worth a listen, but if you're working your way through all the audiobooks, be prepared for some halting moments here and there."||||||||||||

Did I get my fingering right? Was my bow held correctly? Did I have the violin tucked neatly enough under my chin, but not tightly? Then I realize that because I am a musical genius, of course I practiced the concerto, of course the fingering was right, of course my bow was held correctly, of course the violin was held underneath my chin appropriately.

"I apologize. That egocentric braggart, Vice Principal Nero took over my computer momentarily. He's an odd man, who seems to think that he runs the school, even though he's only the VICE principal, and if he's a musical genius, then the song about a cat on a hot tin roof really was about my cat being on a tin roof when lightning struck and not that other metaphor which I will carefully not reveal. I am trying to relate some of what happened to the Baudelaires while they were at my school, but Nero keeps butting in. I'll make sure that I don't leave my desk - with MY advanced computer - until I finish relating the events to which I have been privy. You see, I'm saying """"my"""" because I am, in fact, the Principal."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"Being the clodpole that he is - a word which hear means """"a tone deaf person who is also apparently blind and possesses an I.Q. lower than that of a common forest mammal"""", even though Nero programmed Count Olaf's description into the computer more or less correctly, Count Olaf showed up to trouble the Baudelaire's again. I was extremely upset when I found out about it, especially when I learned the exact identity of the Count and the horrors he had subjected the Baudelaires to, such as notes from Carmelita Spats who is as nice as Nero is a genius."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
But as sad as it was that Count Olaf returned to their lives and inflicted unspeakable tortures upon them (although the Baudelaires may all end up as world class athletes because of it and break many Olympic and world records)| I was heartened to know that while they were here they made the acquaintance of the Quagmire triplets| Duncan and Isadora. Both Duncan and Isadora are very kind| intuitive| intelligent| and magnanimous children| so their association - the only friends the poor children have had since their parents passed away - was a blessing| even if the triplets were...well...I suppose I'm not supposed to give too much away.|||||
||||||||||||
Suffice to say that even though Count Olaf is thwarted in his attempt to capture the Baudelaires| the unfortunate siblings suffer a tragedy on par to that of losing their parents. Sadly| the Board of Directors| all members of an odd acting troupe who call themselves Very Fine Dramatists| won't let me fire Nero| and even though I am the Principal| I answer to this odd V.F.D. group. (Thankfully| they can't force me to attend his silly concerts| the screeching sounds of which seem to have scared away all of the crows in the area.)||||

"P.S. As far as I know, there is only one Lemony Snicket. I can say with certainty that I have never met him, but I know that while Lemony Snicket is a pseudonym, this particular person wrote two *very* adult books using his real name before going undercover and researching the Baudelaires, so the theory of there being two """"Lemony Snickets"""", which seems to be based on the writing in this particular book being more adult and mature, doesn't hold water - a phrase which here means, """"the theory might as well be a bucket with many holes punched into the bottom of it, for if you pour any water into that bucket, within moments you'll have an empty bucket"""". Also, I might add that the Baudelaires are getting slightly older with each book, and given the despicable things that Count Olaf is trying to do them they can't help but mature at a faster rate than most children of their age."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

In this book, the Baudelaires are put in a boarding school where they are made to live in a shack dripping with goo and crawling with small crabs.  If one forgets to make an appointment to see the head of the academy,vice-principal Nero, they are not allowed silverware at mealtimes. Violet's teacher tells stories that are only a few sentences long and boring or non-sensical, and the students are supposed to remember each one. Klaus's teacher has her class measure everything, and to remember each measurement. Sunny, the baby, is made to be Nero's secretary. Every evening, Nero - a terrible violin player - makes all students sit through a six-hour concert of his. The gym teacher is even more hard on the Baudelaires. Every evening, he makes them run laps all night long. One very good thing happens to the children, at last. They make two friends, who are good friends at that. They risk their lives for the Baudelaires and, though Count Olaf did manage to find the children at the academy, at least the Baudelaires escape him. In all probability, we will see their new friends again - that is, if they are still alive."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

(Caution: Possible spoilers!),22-Jan-07,""Coming from a 17 year old:"||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"I thought this book is the best book so far because Snicket mixes it up a little by not introducing us to who Count Olaf is disguised as this time until over half way through the book. The new caretaker of the Baudelaire orphans does not die in the end unlike Uncle Monty (Book 2) and Aunt josefine (Book 3). Snicket also allows Violet and Klaus to """"step into each other's shoes"""" and experience what each other liked to do instead of Klaus always reading and Violet always inventing. I liked how Snicket mixed up the plot and the Baudelaire's being sent off to Boarding School will also be a nice change from being shipped to another caretaker. I also think I like this book the best so far is because I had gotten the """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" movie this past Christmas, and the movie is based only on the first three books. The movie is actually what got me into reading this series, but I think reading this book and having it not been in the movie has made me enjoy it more because I didn't know what was going to happen next, which made it more suspenseful. These books are also light reading; taking me only about two to three hours to finish one of them. I encourage you to continue reading the series and to not give up until you have finished the series. Like I like to say you can't form an opinion on something when you don't know all the fact about what your forming an opinion on."||||||||||||

And now Mr. Poe, who is the person in charge of administering their estate until Violet becomes of age, has gotten the orphans admitted to Prufrock Preparatory School. If you have read the previous books in this series, you are aware that Count Olaf, an evil man that will stop at nothing to get their fortune, has constantly harassed the Baudelaires. One of the reasons why Mr. Poe chose the school to which they are headed is that it has an advance computer system that is supposed to keep the hideous count away."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"Upon their arrival at the school, Violet, Klaus and Sunny start oddities about the place, like the fact that all the buildings are shaped as gravestones and that the school motto is the one shown in the title of this review and means """"Remember you will die"""". But these are mere nuisances that in a different situation would make the children laugh, since they had gone through much worse. Unluckily there are more important obstacles that the children have to face, like vice principal Nero, who is a very annoying and conceited man that spends almost all his time playing the violin...BADLY! He decides to send the siblings to live in the orphan shack and they also have to follow the capricious rules that govern the lives of students at Prufrock. The most important and annoying of these rules is that they have to attend daily a six-hour concert in which Nero performs with his screeching violin. The penalty for not doing that is steep: buy a bag of candy, give it to the vice principal and watch him eat it."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
There are several aspects of this series that I enjoy greatly| and I found all of them in this book| making it one of the best in the series so far. One of these is the cleverly depicted characters| which have characteristics that allow Snicket to create funny situations throughout the story. In this case| we find Nero| who Snicket uses in great fashion to make us laugh. The author also has a great ability for interjecting hilarious comments that are most of times nonsense| but that work well with the tone of the story nevertheless. These also provide a nice balance with the unfortunate situations the Baudelaires go through.||||||
||||||||||||
Of course| Count Olaf shows his ugly face| with his continuous eyebrow| in this story| but we also get the chance to meet a couple of other very interesting characters. Like Carmelita Spats| who is the typical bully present in all schools in this planet. But the orphans also get the chance to meet other orphans| the Quagmire triplets. They only get to meet two of them though| since one of them is dead. The Quagmires also come from a wealthy family and quickly become that Baudelaires' best friends.|||||
||||||||||||
"The new characters provide the story with more depth, and as we have seen in other children's series, like Harry Potter, the plot is starting to be more complex and elaborate. Also, the suspense level is clearly increasing and it is hard to stop between one installment and the next. If you are following this series you will not be disappointed by this episode, and if you have not read any of the books yet, I recommend that you start with """"The Bad Beginning"""", you will not be able to stop after that."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Books 2 through 6 were released close together."||||||||||||
By now| the reader is familiar with his brief respites from the story to introduce his own perils.  In some cases| he puts himself in the story.  In this episode| the Baudelaires seem to find their lives more palatable| nearly as much as when they lived with Uncle Monty.  The Squalors turn out to be comprised of a wimp and a villain.  Much like extensions of Mr. Poe and Count Olaf.  Readers will again enjoy the resourcefulness of the three children| although most of what they encounter and perform is implausible at best.|||||||

"Like the rest of the novels in this series, this book is very slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all, it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However, the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in their new home in the penthouse apartment of the Squallors. The neighborhood is intensely interested in being fashionable and as elevators are now """"out"""" and stairs are """"in"""", the orphans are faced with the daunting prospect of living in the top apartment of a 66-floor skyscraper."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
A note about the audiobook edition of this book: this installment returns to the superb narration of Tim Curry that the early books in the series featured. Curry does an incredible job with the story and it is impossible to not be drawn into his deep| rich narration as he follows the orphans in their adventures.|||||||||||

R. Bird,Don't let the momento mori pass you by,20-Apr-04,""Further dire straights for the siblings three.  Now our Baudelaire friends have been plunged into the depths of academia.  In effect, they are no longer being put into the perilous hands of pseudo (and increasingly dying) relatives.  Instead, they find themselves plunked into Prufrock Prep (motto Momento Mori).  Their Vice Principal Nero is just as insane as their last guardian, but at least his set of crazy rules aren't too terrible.  Though the Baudelaires do have to sleep in a dank, crab infested, fungus dripping shack, they're given enough to eat and new friends.  Enter the Quagmire Triplets (of which there are two).  Like the Baudelaires, their family died under mysterious fire related circumstances.  Such similarities don't end there, however.  The Quagmires also have a fortune awaiting them.  With these new friends, the Baudelaires face up to the newest evil scheme of Count Olaf and his ridiculous disguises.  This time, however, something goes terribly wrong."||||||||||||
"You know what I'd like to see in the series?  I've only read five of these books thus far, and maybe this has already happened, but what I would really like to see someday is Count Olaf actually fool the Baudelaires with a disguise.  Wouldn't that be interesting?  But I suppose part of the point of the books is that Olaf really is a terrible terrible actor, despite his aspirations.  This particular book in the series is a welcome addition.  The first book established the plot, and the next three had a similar formula.  With """"The Austere Academy"""" we get a whole new element thrown in.  The Quagmires are basically just as kind and intelligent as the Baudelaires, but with (ha ha) a little less luck."||||||||||||
"I've come to view these books as a kind of updated """"Alice In Wonderland"""" for our generation.  Like the Alice books, the Baudelaires are the only sane people in a world of half-crazed, maddened, and useless adults.  Unlike Alice, however, they've an evil Count on their trail, constantly attempting to get his oily paws on their fortune.  This is also the first book that I've noticed where Sunny begins using real words on a regular basis.  It just goes to show that though the formula may remain the same, the characters are growing in spite of their circumstances.  It bodes badly for the Baudelaires, and well for the series in general."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Holder,The Elevator is Out,16-Apr-03,""After """"The Austere Academy"""", I wondered whether this series of books could get any better.  They can and they did.  In """"The Ersatz Elevator"""", the sixth book in this series, the Baudelaire orphans move in with a non-relative in a penthouse apartment.  While you might think that a penthouse apartment (which has something like 71 bedrooms) and kitchens, and sitting rooms, and on and on, would be a lovely place to live, you would be thinking wrong, because this is one of the books in """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""", and those of you that have read the previous books know that little good comes to pass concerning the Baudelaire orphans."||||||||||||
"This time the problem is that Esme Squalor (the sixth most important financial advisor in the city) and her husband Jerome are way too hung up on what is """"in"""".  Esme must go to only the """"in"""" restaurants; she must wear only """"in"""" clothes, which includes the children, and on and on.  Unfortunately, being """"in"""" also means multiple compromises in terms of comfort.  For example, the penthouse is on the top of a building with 66 stories, and elevators are """"out"""".  So the Squalors and the Baudelaires must walk up and down the 66 stories each time the go in to and out from the building.  They certainly received sufficient exercise.  Before I forget, orphans are also """"in""""."||||||||||||
Of course| we know that Count Olaf must eventually show up| and he does.  However| there is a mystery.  We find that Count Olaf went up to the apartment and did not later leave the building.  Therein lies the crux of the mystery for this story.|||||||||
This story climaxes with the children running briefly into old friends| and then losing them again.  They also nearly catch Count Olaf| again.  In the end| the children are forced to find a new home once again.  Unfortunately I am unable to tell you more| because Lemony Snicket| should he ever escape from his current predicament| would hunt me down and provide me with agony should I reveal the end of this Baudelaire tale.  Suffice it to say that the Baudelaires have their best adventure yet| with even better to come.|||||
"This series has had its strong points and its weak points.  In general this book is one of the better ones in the series, readily matching """"The Austere Academy"""".  In addition to the direct lessons provided in the book, the children once again are masters of their own fates, and are forced to get themselves out of their predicaments with minimal adult help.  I also enjoyed the moral tale provided by Lemony Snicket regarding people that must always keep up with everyone else in style or fashion.  For this last point alone the book is a must-read for every teenage child."||||||||||||
The violence in this story is a bit more muted than in some of the previous books| and I think that an 8 or 9 year old child should be able to handle the story well.  Certainly Esme could generate a great deal of family discussion of status and whether status is sufficiently important to cause people pain or to break laws.|||||||||||
"In keeping with the trend of the last book, this book continues to expose the children to new experiences and to challenge their abilities to take care of themselves.  Once again, while there are certainly negative aspects to the story, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives.  This book is easily a good successor to """"The Austere Academy"""", and sets a standard for the next books in the series.  I will tell you now that the next two books are just as good as or better than this book and """"The Austere Academy"""", thus continuing the excellence of this unconventional children's series.  5 stars again!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

There are two difficult things the Baudelaires have to go through. One is there is an endless flight of stairs. Another is there are stuff that are 'in' and stuff that are 'out'. One 'out' thing is elevators. One 'in' thing is pinstripe suits. This hilarious and splendid book is the best so far. A seventy one bedroom apartment, a terrible and visible disguise, an auction gone wrong, an empty elevator shaft, the return of the Quagmires and an evil guardian are just few of many and many terrible events that go on in this book. Violet's inventing skills prove well. Klaus is always recourceful. And Sunny helps also to bringing the Baudelaires to safety. What is also astonishing is what they find at the end of a narrow turny passage below an elevator shaft."||||||||||||

Lemony Snicket's best book so far| I hope the next books stay the same. I recommend  you buy this book. It is full of action. Lemony Snicket maintains and records the terrible but exciting lives of the Baudelaires.|||||||||||

This story is called The Miserable Mill by Lemony Snicket. They have been sent to live at a company called Lucky Smells Lumbermill. The worst part of it all is that they must work there as employees. They are awoken by a man by the name of Foreman Flacutono.Today is there first day of work. To """"skin"""" a log the children must use debarkers. Sunny on the other hand chooses to use her teeth. The children are fed gum for lunch. They are paid in coupons instead of money, which makes the coupons worthless. Later that day they meet their guardian who goes by the name of Sir. He has a cloud of smoke around his head, due to the fact that he is always smoking a cigar. They meet his nice associate Charles. He gives the children raisins and jerky when he has the oppurtunity to do so. He claims to own a library, which the children are overjoyed with but to their dismay there are only three books. As weeks go by, Foreman Flacutono eventually plays a cruel joke on Klaus.He puts his foot out causing Klaus to slip and break his glasses. He must go to Dr.Orwell to get new glasses. When he finally returns, he acts like a """"robot,"""" doing commands that are made to him. He causes an accident, breaking Phil's leg. He then acts his """"normal"""" self. Once again he breaks his glasses. He acts as a """"robot"""" again but eventually returned to normal. Yet he breaks his glasses again but this time Violet and Sunny go with them. Klaus goes with Dr. Orwell to get glasses. In the waiting room though Violet and Sunny discover Count Olaf as the identity of Shirley.They learn that Klaus has been getting hypnotized. One night in the mill Count Olaf and his henchmen are there.One is killed but Count Olaf and the other get away."||||||||||||
"I liked this book because Lemony Snicket gives definitions of those tough words nobody understands.Such as,""""Derix!""""which probably meant along the lines of,""""If we can't prevent him from going to Dr.Orwell, at least we can go with him!""""Another one is,""""Tanco!"""" Sunny Shrieked, which meant something along the lines of """"And babies should't even have gum, because they could choke on it!"""""||||||||||||
I disliked this book due to the fact that someone dies. Even though the person who died was bad| she was brutally killed. Killed by the saw of the mill. OUCH. Also I didn't like that Klaus's glasses kept on breaking. It got both annoying and predictable.|||||||||||
"My favorite part was when the Baudelaire children revealed Count Olaf's identity to everyone. I always enjoy when they figure his scheme and foil his plans.Although he always runs away, not to be seen for awhile. I always enjoy these books and can't wait to read the next one."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

In exchange for their work, their guardian, Sir, would keep Count Olaf from harming them. While working at the lumbermill, Klaus’ glasses were broken after he was was tripped by the foreman, Flacutono. He was sent to an optometrist, and upon his return, he was hypnotized. The foreman tripped Klaus a second time and sent him to the optometrist, but this time, his two siblings accompanied him. Once again, he returns in hypnotized. It turns out that the optometrist was working with Flacutono and Count Olaf. The children are sent to Prufrock Prepatory School by Mr. Poe in hopes of continuing their run of luck. I would give this book a thumbs up; it is dark, twisted, and an interesting read. I would say that this book would be idea for students in the fifth grade. It is relatively short and easy to comprehend, but it should be noted that the content in the book is best for children older than ten years old. A great activity to go alongside this book would be to have your students write the next chapter. This gives them an opportunity to use their imagination to build a sequel based on the information that they absorbed from this book. The details in The Miserable Mill are simply great. The author does an excellent job painting a clear, concise image of the setting, objects, and action throughout the text.

I don't want to give it away, but I could not stop laughing. Sometimes I wonder how Count Olaf even gets away with things, he's just as dumb as all the other adults around, the only difference is that he's 10x's more evil. ;P"||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"  Book 4 only has a 4 star average, I'm not sure why, because I don't read reviews for things until I've reviewed them myself(that is unless I read the reviews before I read the book).  I have a feeling its because of the child labor issue, which is a very touchy issue.  The way that the head """"Sir"""" of the Mill treats the children is abominable. How can you let children, let alone a baby work in a lumber mill? But so it goes. Not all the adults are like that, but all of them are clueless or too fearful to help the orphans."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
  This book| was the one that really hooked me in. Surprisingly enough| I didn't enjoy the last 3 very much.  I assume it is because I wasnot yet accustomed to Lemony Snicket's oddball humor. The intro to this book was the funniest out of all 13. It was hilarious.! I could not stop laughing.! The funny thing about these stories is that every person they go to live with| no matter how horrid they may be| they're able to take something from the experience and use against Count Olaf| even though he always wins.|||||||
||||||||||||
  As Lemony Snicket always warns| if you hate sad stories| and prefer happy endings| pick up another book| because this wont satisify you. But...If you enjoy dire situations| a little hope and major letdowns| and absolutely despicable villians| then you'll love this volume of Unfortunate Events.|||||

Holder,A Change of Place and Pace for the Baudelaires,5-Apr-06,""For the fifth book in the saga """"A Series of Unfortunate Events,"""" starring the three Baudelaire orphans Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny, the series implements several changes, all for the better."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
The first change is that we are no longer with a relative. Instead| we are at Prufrock Academy| a boarding school. Secondly| the Baudelaires acquire two friends at this school. There are additional positives. They actually get to eat| they get to study| and they get to read. For a moment you might actually think that things are looking up for the Baudelaires. Ah| but for those familiar with the series| you know that can't be true.|||||
||||||||||||
If the Baudelaires violate any of a series of bizarre rules they must endure a series of equally bizarre punishments relating to their meals. Included in this list of punishments is loss of silverware| loss of a cup| though you still get your drink| it's just in a puddle on your tray| and even having your hands tied behind your back at mealtime.||||||||
||||||||||||
"The Baudelaires also must endure six hours of bad violin music each night by the exquisitely horrible violinist, Vice Principal Nero. If you have ever heard violin played badly, you might realize that you would almost rather hear fingernails scrapping across a blackboard, almost. If you miss one of Nero's concerts you must pay him a bag of candy. As you have now realized, this school is terrible, though admittedly things start out much better than they did in """"The Miserable Mill."""""||||||||||||
||||||||||||
As you have probably also guessed| Count Olaf does eventually show up. However| Count Olaf does not immediately try to spirit the children away from Prufrock Academy. Instead| he has them exercise nightly| all night long. The children try to figure out his scheme all the way up to the point where he does execute his scheme| and I can say no more or you will miss all the fun.|||||||
||||||||||||
In this book the children meet triplets who are now twins because one of the twins died. The five children become good friends because they are all orphans. Furthermore| they all get along well and work together to try and beat Count Olaf. However| the children are generally at the mercy of Count Olaf almost from the point he shows up to nearly the end of the story.||||||||||
||||||||||||
"While in the previous books the children largely escaped from Count Olaf due to their own abilities, this time the children are saved due to a combination of fortunate circumstances, including the help of their new friends. We do not find out where the children are going next at the end of this book, but of course we know that they will have another home in """"The Ersatz Elevator."""""||||||||||||
||||||||||||
The educational messages in this book came roaring back after what I thought were relatively weaker messages in the last book. This time the children get to learn a variety of new words| and they learn that there is value in true friendship. The children also display a good amount of trust in their new friends| which has been difficult for them to give in previous books. One educational opportunity in this book is the chance for parents to deal with the subject of kidnapping. In order to not spoil the story I'll not tell you any details| but a question parents could ask their children is whether the children or the school could have done something to prevent the kidnapping from occurring.|||||||||
||||||||||||
I've considered the previous books in this series to be more suitable for children approximately 9 and older. This book is milder than the previous books| and I think an 8-year-old child should be able to handle it well. As always| you should know your child and his or her ability to handle the subject matter within.||||||||||
||||||||||||
Note that there are several editions of this book now available.  You may wish to survey the versions available and their cost prior to buying in order to determine which version meets your needs best.||||||||||||

All the books follow a similar pattern, but each is interesting and unique.  He plays with words in interesting ways, expanding the child reader's vocabulary without them even realizing that they are being taught.  But most important in the books, is the message of perseverance through diversity, the love of family, and the importance of true friendship.  In a world that portrays the mythical exsistance of an easy world, the author helps to balance that perspective by providing a different view.  It also shows how important and dependent the children are on one another, each using his or his special talents to benefit the group as a whole.

||||||||||||
For followers of this series| you all know where the kids are from| but for new| I suggest reading from the first book to know what exactly been going on. The Unfortunate Events Series brings you the story of the Baudelaire Orphans| Violet (the oldest and the inventor)| Klaus (second borned and the genius bookworm) and Violet (youngest and the biter). Their parent died from horrible fire that burnt their house down to the ground and since then they have been moving from home to another starting from Count Olaf (who'se determined to get the Baudelaire Orphan's fortune) to their Uncle Monty's Reptile House and their Phobic Aunt Josephine.|||||||
||||||||||||
Things hadn't improved since we last seen the Baudelaire Orphans. Mr Poe| their fortunes caretaker until Violet comes to an age| took them to their next guardian who's the owner of the Lucky Smells Lumbermill in Paltryville| where they are made to work in the mill and they shared the place to sleep with the rest of the workers. Close to their cabin| to their horror a building that resembled the mark of Count Olaf!||||||||
||||||||||||
In this Lucky Smells Lumbermills the only option of food for them is Gum and occasionally bits and pieces of food from Charles| their guardian's partner| one of the good people they know there| next to Phil| the extreme optimist who tried to look things in their bright side.||||||||
||||||||||||
Their foreman| named Foreman Flacutono| who just won't give them a break| and also one of the pawns to make the Baudelaire Orphans' life as miserable as the place itself. With the simple prank by him| Klaus was sent to the building that bears the mark of the feared Count Olaf (who seems to be missing) and came out all wrong. He was hypnotized! While he was under it| he did things unimaginable!|||||||

||||||||||||
"Esme Squalor (no pun intended with regard to her last name I'm sure!), the city's sixth most important financial advisor, is only interested in something if it is """"in"""", and so ridiculous is she that if light - actual sunlight - is """"out"""", then down go the drapes and the entire apartment, all seventy-one bedrooms of it, is drenched in darkness. If elevators are out, then stairs must be climbed, floor by painful floor, from the lobby to the penthouse. If pinstriped suits, no matter how ludicrous they look on children, are """"in"""", then the Baudelaires will be draped in them. And if aqueous martinis are """"in"""", then one has an aqueous martini - which is a glass of water with an olive in it. Although when you consider that last one, it is certainly healthier than an alcoholic martini."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
Her poor husband| Jerome| may or may not agree with the seemingly mad influences that bind his wife| but the poor man doesn't like to argue| so he goes along with her| even if it means eating salmon| which he particularly dislikes.||||||
||||||||||||
Count Olaf makes his usual appearance| in a disguise so see through that if it were a negligee it would be embarrassingly revealing| but of course he goes undetected. This is thought| by some| to be a weakness of the series. I disagree. I think it's one of the strong points. Count Olaf's single-minded determination to get his hands on the fortune of the Baudelaires| and the mind boggling lengths he'll go to get it| are all part of the charm of the tale.||||||
||||||||||||
And since Count Olaf is in the book| life is difficult| again| for the Baudelaires| and they find themselves working ever so closely together to try and escape the elaborate and well thought out plan (the plans| btw| get more intricate| and better and better as the series progresses). Once again| this story winds up not being about the horrible things that happen to the Baudelaires| but about this trio's ability to unite together. Their refusal to give in - which would be the easiest thing to do - is heartwarming and inspirational.|||

"A lot of people say that the """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" books are all the same and that they get boring, but I think that almost every series there is isn't that different. Take a detective book or TV show, for example. You know that there's going to be a crime, and that the detective will solve the mystery, but you don't know how and you don't know the setting of that particular story. I think that in these books, it's just more obvious that Lemony Snicket uses the same general story in his books."||||||||||||

"In this one, the three kids go to a boarding school, that has really silly rules. They really made me laugh. All their punnishments have to do with eating somehow. No student is allowed in the administrative building and if they went in there, they'd have their silverware taken away from them. (Sunny is actually an assistant in the administrative building, so her silverware is always taken away from her!) If anyone is late to class, they would get their hands tied behind their back and have to """"eat like a dog"""". The meals are served at """"breakfast time, lunchtime, and dinnertime"""" and if anyone is late, their cups will be taken away from them and their beverages will be served in puddles.

R. Bird,They're in with the in crowd,3-May-04,""To say that a Lemony Snicket book has taken a turn for the worse is the equivalent of repeating the word """"moot"""" twenty-five times in a row.  It's redundant.  Yes, of course the poor Baudelaire siblings are in dire straights.  But as it happens, this book is a little different from the others in the series.  Suddenly the siblings are placed in the predicament of attempting to save someone other than themselves from the evil Count Olaf.  Worse still, they have to actively try to find the Count when the heat is on.  Such a strange reversal of fortunes is just what the series needed to liven it up a bit.  Consider """"The Ersatz Elevator"""" very lively indeed."||||||||||||
"No more boarding schools for the Baudelaire orphans.  Mr. Poe, their ineffectual guardian, has once more placed them with relatives, no matter how distant.  In this particular case, the Squalors are the couple of choice.  Horrendously rich and living in a ridiculously large penthouse, the children find themselves with a woman who is apparently solely concerned with what is """"in"""" and what is """"out"""".  Acqueous martinis (water with an olive) are in.  Elevators, especially the one that would let the children get to the penthouse with ease, are out.  Orphans, as it happens, are also in.  Unfortunately, before the kids can find out what happens to orphans when they become """"out"""" they run once more into the nasty Count Olaf.  Disguised now as a foreign auctioneer, the Count seems to have increased in both nastiness and cleverness.  It takes everything the Baudelaires have to work against this man and try to locate their friends, the captive Quagmire triplets."||||||||||||
The book is| more than anything else| a delightful trumping of the rich.  With his finger planted firmly on the elite's obsession with the latest fad| Esme Squalor is nothing so much as a living breathing caricature of sublime ineptitude.  When asked why she won't give money to a family who is poor and has lost their home| she reasons that if she gave them money they wouldn't be poor anymore.  Such is the mindset of the many people who just don't happen to put it in so many words.||||||||
There are some real surprises in this latest book.  I don't mind telling you that there were two moment of real breath taking shock for me in this book.  The first occurred after Violet| Klaus| and Sunny discover something unexpected at the bottom of the ersatz elevator.  The second occured when a character plunged the Bauldelaires into terrifying and certain danger.  Fabulous.||||||||||
"The ending of this book is a little more dour than that of the previous ones, but let it never be said that the author doesn't end the books on a hopeful note.  Rest assured that in the end, the three siblings can stand strong as they always have, no matter what horrendous things happen to them.  And just a note: The plot is thickening more and more.  Characters are giving away clues to the mysterious VFD.  Beatrice's name is coming from a mouth other than the author's.  And the Baudelaires find themselves in a very familiar sooty place, much to their amazement.  Be sure to read the most exciting Unfortunate Event yet!  It'll be sure to raise more questions than it answers..."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

There was a sense of staleness (and meanness) that kept Mill from being as chaotically fun as its predecessors, and you might be forgiven for starting to wonder if the series was worth sticking with. Then, along comes The Austere Academy, and everything starts to change. The orphans, for the first time in the series, make some friends who understand what they're going through. They're free from a traditional guardian, and instead, enrolled in a gleefully bizarre school that looks like nothing so much as a massive graveyard. Count Olaf makes his customary appearance, but his plan remains a lot less clear and far more mysterious than it has in the past, leading the orphans into a minefield of uncertainty. But none of that, though it's all enjoyable, is what makes Austere Academy such a breath of fresh air. No, it all comes down to two key moments in the story: one, another seemingly random story by Snicket that ends up completely changing your perception of his role in the story; the second, a brief clue uttered near the book's end that's going to change the series from here on out. What both of these things mean, I leave it to readers of the series to discover; suffice to say, The Austere Academy finds Snicket stepping up his game and changing what seemed like an entertaining but slight series into something far more complex and fascinating. So, if you were worried about the series, worry no more; from here on out, The Series of Unfortunate Events is going to be much, much more complicated and twisty than you might think - and far, far more mysterious (to put it mildly)."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

I know the Baudelaire siblings weren't very happy when they found themselves in the clutches of Count Olaf in their first adventure.  And it cannot have been pleasant to find good old Uncle Monty dead in the second.  And certainly there was a lot of danger and difficulty in sailing across a leech filled lake in the third.  But to find themselves essentially child slaves working in a mill (and paid with coupons) for an employer whose name they don't even know... well that's just plain awful."||||||||||||
"Things look pretty bleak for the Baudelaires this time, but they are determined to keep fighting.  In """"The Miserable Mill"""", Snicket draws the undeniable differences between keeping one's chin up while accepting one's own problems and being an incurable optimist.  The Baudelaires meet an optimist in a fellow worker at the mill, and somehow the man's cheery euphemisms miraculously do not send the kids over the edge.  Then there's Count Olaf to deal with.  Dressed in his silliest disguise yet (and that's saying something) the Count is determined to use everything from hypnotism (all thanks to the help of the wonderfully monikered Dr. Orwell) to death by saw mill itself to get the orphans and their money.  In the end the children succeed, though I was somewhat confused by their wish to remain at the miserable mill.  Certainly they did not have fun there, but who am I to say?  In any case, the book is a delightful addition to the Series of Unfortunate Events.  One can only hope their next home will be a little more enjoyable (though the likelihood of that is....)."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

It is a great book. This book was puzzling when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny were trying to find out what V.F.D. stood for. It was mysterious when the Baudelaire orphans went inside the elevator and found the Quagmire Triplets. It was mysterious because why would Count Olaf have them there and not already shipped them off to another island to take their fortune? I also liked that Lemony Snicket used big words, and then gives the definitions to tell what they are. It was good that the Baudelaires took action by themselves, instead of asking or having help from an adult.

In this book, Violet the inventor, Klaus the reader, and Sunny the biter are (whose parents` died in a terrible fire in the first book, and ever since then they encounter countless misfortunes) are raised by Esme and Jerome Squalor on 667 Dark Avenue during this book`s events. The Squalors live in an enormous seventy-one room penthouse on top of a sixty-six floor apartment. Esme Squalor is obsessed with what's """"in"""" (the word she uses for """"cool"""") and what's """"out"""" (the word she uses for """"uncool""""). Jerome Squalor is an interesting and friendly character who just does as his wife commands because he dislikes arguing. Unfortunately for the Baudelaires, Count Olaf shows up again in yet another disguise: Gunther, the auctioner at the In Auction (a famous auction that will auction off things that are """"in""""). The Baudelaires must foil Count Olaf's plan, discover the secret of V.F.D., rescue the Quaqmire triplets, and find out if the mysterious elevator is simply """"out"""" because it is uncool - or because there's something more to it that the naked eye doesn't notice. In all, this an extremely excellent book that I recommend to anyone that has been enjoying the Baudelaires adventures or that simply likes a good mystery. This book is very suspenseful at the end when a lot of the unresolved puzzles start fitting and the children must get to the In Auction in time to [well, I won't spoil it for you]. In my opinion, this is really were the series begins because the V.F.D. mystery really starts in this volume. Also, a great things that makes readers enjoy this book is the unexpected twist at the end. I won't say anymore, just read this book for yourself to see exactly how good it truly is! If you like this book, then I recommend you ALL of the other books in the A Series of Unfortunate Events book series.

"In this story the Baudelaires are sent to an academy called the Austere Academy. It all begins in a small office. It is the office of their guardian and Vice Principal. His name is Nero. His computer will keep away Count Olaf, or so he says. Sunny is his secretary and Violet and Klaus are students at the academy. Violet's teacher is Mr.Remora and Klaus's teacher is Mrs.Bass. Mr.Remora talks about boring stories and Mrs.Bass measures everthing. The Baudelaires meet friends in this story(finally!). They are triplets named Isadora and Duncan. Their triplet died in a fire, so people mistake them for twins. The students must go to violin recitals for six hours each and every night. The Baudelaires have to live in a shack. They have to do a program called S.O.R.E. with their teacher Coach Genghis(who is really Count Olaf). At the end Count Olaf kidnaps Isadora and Duncan while they shout """"VFD."""""||||||||||||
"I liked this book because of Mr.Remora and Mrs.Bass. Mr.Remora tells boring and pointless stories about himself all day long. An example is """"One day I went to the store to purchase a carton of milk."""" Mrs.Bass makes her students measure, well everything she has to offer. One example is """"I've got a box of pencils I want you all to measure."""" The teachers lend humor to the book and our nice people."||||||||||||
I disliked this book due to the program called S.O.R.E. Having kids run countless laps around a field every night| I think| is just sad and wrong. They even made Sunny run| although it was really more like crawling as fast as she could. Coach Genghis is getting them in trouble with their teachers and Vice Principal Nero. They are also very tired and basically fall behind in their studies.|||||||||
"My favorite part of this book was the part when the Baudelaires became friends with Isadora and Duncan. After all the horrible things that happened to them they get this one happy moment. Even though they get kidnapped at the end they are all still good friends.

He took them there bacause he coudn't take care of them. The children, Klaus,violet, and Sunny, met Mr.Nero, the vice principal. Mr. Nero likes to play the violin. The vice principal gave them a lot of rules and if they didn't follow them, they would get punishments. One day, they didn't follow one of the rules. The rule was, """"No entering the office without an appointment."""" Their punishment was, they didn't get silverware at lunch. At lunch, they met Isadore and Duncan. Violet noticed twins at their table and mentioned it, and they got upset. They were not twins but triplets. The other brother died in a fire with their parents. Then after lunch, they went with the vice principal so they would know where they were going to slepp. Nero told them they would stay in an orphanage. They could stay in a neat room, but they didn't have a guardian. Then they met Mr. Genghis, the new gym teacher. Well, not really, it was Count Olaf. Count Olaft wasnts the Baudelair's fortune.

The three Baudelaire orphans just seem to always have misfortune following them -- and their miserable lives are about to become even worse. They have been sent to stay in under the care of a man who, quite mysteriously, has a cloud of smoke where his head should be. Assigned to work in a horrid mill that the three children find almost impossible to endure, their lives worsen by each day. And for some reason their evil uncle, Count Olaf, hasn't been seen around -- but little do they know where -- and how -- their evil uncle is lurking in the shadows. Can they solve a horrible mystery, avoid torture, and make their stay out alive? Or will Count Olaf for once be the victor of the Baudelaire fortune? This was one of the most hilarious books I have ever read, and Lemony Snicket's Series Of Unfortunate Events is so darkly funny I found it impossible to put down.

I also enjoy how intelligent the orphans are when the adults around them seem to be so dim.  While they rely on adults to save them each time, it's really the children who find out the plots and schemes and go through the books trying to get the adults to figure it out too, all the while inventing and reading and coming up with ways to stop Count Olaf.

Violet and Klaus must attend boring classes and since Sunny is too young to go to school, she is made an administrative assistant.

I really liked this book because the Baudelaires finally seemed less hopeless because they made new friends named the Quagmire triplets. Their names were Isadora, Duncan, and Quigley, but Quigley died in a fire with the Quagmire parents. Of course, Count Olaf shows up in this book, and he is dressed as their new physical exercise teacher. He wears a turban to cover his long eyebrow, long running shoes to cover his tattoo, and dresses in a shirt and shorts, dressed normally like a physical exercise teacher. The Baudelaires also make an enemy in this book named Carmelita Spats."||||||||||||
"In the book before this one, the poor children had to work in a Lumbermill. Now they are stuck in a boarding school named The Austere Academy. The motto of this school is """"Rememeber You Will Die."""" The person in charge of this graveyard looking school is a man called Principal Nero who doesn't know how to play the violin but does anyway. The Orphans live in the Orphans shack, which is covered with tan colored fungus and tiny crabs that pinch, and of course the ugly looking wallapaper on the ugly walls. The Baudelaires feel so depressed until two twins stick up for them when Carmelita Spats makes fun of them. The Baudelaires have their ups and downs in this book, but in the end they feel more miserable than they can ever be. At least in this book, they felt happy at some points."||||||||||||
"The reason I liked this book is because it was so fun and full of happy and bad thoughts. But for once the Baudelaires had a chance to experience happiness in a long time. The Quagmires really helped them get used to the school and I'm really thankful that Lemony Snicket wrote about them because the Baudelaires always felt so tortured. The reason I didn't like this book was because the Baudelaires felt so unhappy at the end of this book.

The Austere Acadamy is a longer and more robust entry into the Series of Unfortunate Events, and it's what I've been waiting for: something which maintains the engaging premise and Snicket's perfected voice without being content with reiteration.

It is about three children named Klaus, Violet, and Sunny, also known as the Baudelaire orphans. The three children have a really miserable life. They go to this mill to meet their new guardian. The mill is really horrible and they are trying to avoid Count Olaf. In the end, they find Count Olaf and he escapes. Count Olaf was dressed up like a girl to fool the children.  When they found out that Klaus was hypnotized after going to see the eye doctor they knew something was weird."||||||||||||
"  The thing I liked about this book was that the author would always be detailed, but I don't really like it when the author writes a word and then tell what it means. For example, in the story they have: """"In order to hmmm the hypnotic holds on the hmmm,"""" Violet said, """"the same method hmmm is used: an hmmm word, uttered out loud, will hmmm the hmmm immediately. I think Dr. Orwell is talking about getting people un-hypnotized, and it has to do with another word being uttered out loud. And he is really descriptive, such as, he was wearing a bright blue vest and holding a peach. He smiled and walked toward them. But then frown as he drew closer."||||||||||||
"  My favorite part is when Klaus is hypnotized and he does these weird things. Such as, he calls his sister, Violet sir. He doesn't remember what he is supposed to do any many other things."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Holder,A Change of Place and Pace for the Baudelaires,7-Apr-03,""For the fifth book in the saga """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""", starring the three Baudelaire orphans Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny, the series implements several changes, all for the better."||||||||||||
The first change is that we are no longer with a relative.  Instead| we are at Prufrock Academy| a boarding school.  Secondly| the Baudelaire's acquire two friends at this new school.  There are additional positives.  They actually get to eat| they get to study| and they get to read.  For a moment you might actually think that things are looking up for the Baudelaires.  Ah| but for those familiar with the series| you know that can't be true.|||||
If the Baudelaires violate any of a series of bizarre rules they must endure a series of equally bizarre punishments relating to their meals.  Included in this list of punishments is loss of silverware| loss of a cup| though you still get your drink| it's just in a puddle on your tray| and even having your hands tied behind your back at mealtime.||||||||
"The Baudelaires also must endure six hours of bad violin music each night by the exquisitely horrible violinist, Vice Principal Nero.  If you have ever heard violin played badly, you might realize that you could almost rather hear fingernails scrapping across a blackboard, almost.  If you miss one of Nero's concerts you must pay him a bag of candy.  As you have now realized, this school is terrible, though admittedly things start out much better than they did in """"The Miserable Mill""""."||||||||||||
As you have probably also guessed| Count Olaf does eventually show up.  However| Count Olaf does not immediately try to spirit the children away from Prufrock Academy.  Instead| he has them exercise nightly| all night long.  The children try to figure out his scheme all the way up to the point where he does execute his scheme| and I can say no more or you will miss all the fun.|||||||
In this book the children meet triplets who are now twins because one of the twins died.  The five children become good friends because they are all orphans.  Furthermore| they all get along well and work together to try and beat Count Olaf.  However| the children are generally at the mercy of Count Olaf almost from the point he shows up to nearly the end of the story.||||||||||
"While in the previous books the children largely escaped from Count Olaf due to their own abilities, this time the children are saved due to a combination of fortunate circumstances, including the help of their new friends.  We do not find out where the children are going next at the end of this book, but of course we know that they will have another home in """"The Ersatz Elevator""""."||||||||||||
The educational messages in this book came roaring back after what I thought were relatively weaker messages in the last book.  This time the children get to learn a variety of new words| and they also learn that there is value in true friendship.  The children also display a good amount of trust in their new friends| which has been difficult for them to give in previous books.  One educational opportunity in this book is the chance for parents to deal with the subject of kidnapping.  In order to not spoil the story I'll not tell you any details| but a question parents could ask their children is whether the children or the school could have done something to prevent the kidnapping from occurring.|||||||||
I've considered the previous books in this series to be more suitable for children approximately 9 and older.  This book is milder than the previous books| and I think an 8-year-old child should be able to handle it well.  As always| you should know your child and his or her ability to handle the subject matter within.||||||||||
"This book was quite a change from the previous books.  The children have multiple new experiences, and there are a lot more positive aspects to help temper the negative aspects.  I consider this book to be the best of the series thus far; 5 stars!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

||||||||||||
"I came to this series after already watching the tie-in movie """"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"""". I loved the first three books in the series, but """"The Miserable Mill"""" was something of a mystery to me going in, since it represented the first book in the series that the movie did not cover. I shouldn't have been worried, however, for this novel is in many ways one of the best in the series so far."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"Like the rest of the novels in this series, this book is very slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all, it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However, the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in their new """"home"""" as workers in the Lucky Strikes Lumber Mill. Having been handed over to their new guardian """"Sir"""", he immediately puts them to work as child slaves in his lumber mill in exchange for keeping Count Olaf away from them. The work is hard and not suitable for young children, but the Baudelaire orphans try to look on the bright side in their new job."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"A note about the audiobook edition of this book: like the previous book (""""The Wide Window""""), this installment in the series is narrated by """"Lemony Snicket"""" (who in this case I assume is the author, Handler). Handler is a superb writer, but his narration is a little jarring after the smooth tones of Tim Curry's previous narration (of """"The Bad Beginning"""" and """"The Reptile Room""""). In particular, the narration here stutters and jolts over Sir's dialogue and the overall result is extremely distracting and sometimes difficult for the listener to stay immersed. The overall narration is still worth a listen, but if you're working your way through all the audiobooks, be prepared for some halting moments."||||||||||||

I'm 10. In this book, the Baudelaire orphans have to go to a creepy school called Prufrock Preparatory School. Its motto is Memento Mori, which is Latin for """"Remember you will die"""". Yeah, sounds like a GREAT school, huh? The principal there is super austere, a word which here means """"stern and severe"""". For example, he takes away your silverware if you go to the administrative building. Since one of the Baudelaires, Sunny, was too young to go to school there, she had to work as an administrative assistant, so they took away her silverware. The teachers there are very boring. Violet's teacher, Mr. Remora, just tells boring stories, and Klaus's teacher, Mrs. Bass, just makes the students measure things. There is a really mean girl there named Carmelita Spats, and she was really mean, but also funny.

I was so glad then to find the fifth book expanding and bringing in new characters who look like they could be around in future books. Mr Poe packs Violet, Klaus , and Sunny off to a horrible boarding school that has ridiculous rules. Of course you wait to see when the evil Count Olaf will rear his head, but the distraction in the book comes from the addition of two children the same age as Violet and Klaus who become their friends. It gives the series new places to go and breaks the normal story outlines. It's also the longest so far but for me it read the fastest.

The plot is evident from other reviews, so I won't get into that."||||||||||||
"For instance, the baby, Sunny, when speaking 'gibberish,' really spouts out relavent information to the diologue in one word phrases borrowed from other languages or people's names (for instance, when discussing poetry, Sunny uses the word """"Sappho,"""" the name of a well-known Greek poetess)."||||||||||||
What I find more interesting than just the book's characters or plot is the underlying reason why 'Snicket' (a pseudonym| perhaps?) wrote these books.  He continually makes references to a Beatrice in his books| and from what I gather| Beatrice is a woman the author loved| but she married another man and died shortly thereafter.  The books seem to be about the man she married instead of the author (who is 'Count Olaf' and made out to be entirely horrible).||||||||

Holder,The Elevator is Out,5-Apr-06,""After """"The Austere Academy,"""" I wondered whether this series of books could get any better.  They can and they did.  In """"The Ersatz Elevator,"""" the sixth book in this series, the Baudelaire orphans move in with a non-relative in a penthouse apartment.  While you might think that a penthouse apartment, which has something like 71 bedrooms and kitchens, and sitting rooms, and on and on, would be a lovely place to live, you would be thinking wrong, because this is one of the books in """"A Series of Unfortunate Events,"""" and those of you that have read the previous books know that little good comes to pass concerning the Baudelaire orphans."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"This time the problem is that Esme Squalor (the sixth most important financial advisor in the city) and her husband Jerome are way too hung up on what is """"in"""".  Esme must go to only the """"in"""" restaurants; she must wear only """"in"""" clothes, which includes the children, and on and on.  Unfortunately, being """"in"""" also means multiple compromises in terms of comfort.  For example, the penthouse is on the top of a building with 66 stories, and elevators are """"out"""".  So the Squalors and the Baudelaires must walk up and down the 66 stories each time the go in to and out from the building.  They certainly received sufficient exercise.  Before I forget, orphans are also """"in""""."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
Of course| we know that Count Olaf must eventually show up| and he does.  However| there is a mystery.  We find that Count Olaf went up to the apartment and did not later leave the building.  Therein lies the crux of the mystery for this story.|||||||||
||||||||||||
This story climaxes with the children running briefly into old friends| and then losing them again.  They also nearly catch Count Olaf| again.  In the end| the children are forced to find a new home once again.  Unfortunately I am unable to tell you more| because Lemony Snicket| should he ever escape from his current predicament| would hunt me down and provide me with agony should I reveal the end of this Baudelaire tale.  Suffice it to say that the Baudelaires have their best adventure yet| with even better to come.|||||
||||||||||||
"This series has had its strong points and its weak points.  In general this book is one of the better ones in the series, readily matching """"The Austere Academy.""""  In addition to the direct lessons provided in the book, the children once again are masters of their own fates, and are forced to get themselves out of their predicaments with minimal adult help.  I also enjoyed the moral tale provided by Lemony Snicket regarding people that must always keep up with everyone else in style or fashion.  For this last point alone the book is a must-read for every teenage child."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
The violence in this story is a bit more muted than in some of the previous books| and I think that an 8 or 9 year old child should be able to handle the story well.  Certainly Esme could generate a great deal of family discussion of status and whether status is sufficiently important to cause people pain or to break laws.|||||||||||
||||||||||||
"In keeping with the trend of the last book, this book continues to expose the children to new experiences and to challenge their abilities to take care of themselves.  Once again, while there are certainly negative aspects to the story, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives.  This book is easily a good successor to """"The Austere Academy,"""" and sets a standard for the next books in the series.  I will tell you now that the next two books are just as good as or better than this book and """"The Austere Academy,"""" thus continuing the excellence of this unconventional children's series.  5 stars again!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

  A Series of Unfortunate Events- The Austere Academy||||||||||||
  by Lemony Snicket||||||||||||
 This is the fifth book is the Series of Unfortunate Events called The Austere Academy.  In this book we again find the three orphaned Baudelaire children| Violet| Sunny| and Klaus| on another of their very unfortunate adventures.  They meet very helpful friends named Isadora and Duncan.  Count Olaf disguises himself as a P. E teacher to try to get the orphans money.  He tries to make them so tired that they slack off in school| so they would have to live with him.  They also have made friends with to great kids.  When Count Olaf finds out that they too have a fortune| and they have found out that he was disguised| he kidnaps Duncan and Isadora!|||||
 I liked this book because the three orphans made two friends.  They helped them with their plan.  They also helped them find out Count Olaf?s Plans.  ??It is sure a good thing that we ran in to you twins! (P. 50)? Even thought the story doesn?t have a happy ending| or other any happy things| this was a happy thing.  To me| it was fun to see how the relationship between them grew and to see all the inventions they were making up.|||||||||
 The part that I didn?t like about the book was how Count Olaf kidnapped Isadora and Duncan.  To me this was very sad because they were the only two people that were nice to the Baudelaire?s.  ??No!? Klaus screamed| but Count Olaf merely smiled stepped on to the front seat| and began driving away| just as Violet and Sunny reached their brother. (P.216)?? Duncan and Isadora had been researching Count Olaf and wrote about him in their notebooks.  Before they drove away they told the Baudelaire?s to look in their notebooks| but Count Olaf snatched them away!  Now the orphans need to fond out what they found out.  Now they are probably going to end up on| yet another| unfortunate adventure.||||||
" My favorite part of the book is when Violet is making staples for sunny, because sunny (who is also a little baby) was a secretary for vice Principal Nero.  Violet was always good at making inventions, and now her genius really shows.  Since they don?t have a guardian to sign a permission slip for a dorm room they have to sleep in a little shack.  The shack has fungus and crabs, violet very cleverly uses them, and creamed spinach.  The crabs like to pinch toes, so violet puts a potato by their pincers, and when they are about to strike it, she moves the potato and puts some metal in its place.  She makes glue out of the creamed spinach and uses it to hold a fork.  When she?s done she uses it to shape the staples around.  I would recommend this book because it is fun, sad, and suspenseful."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

||||||||||||
"The book """"Series of Unfortunate Events Book #5 The Austere Academy"""" by Lemony Snicket was about 3 orphans Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. The orphans had just come from another vague ancestor and another encounter with the evil count Olaf trying to steal the enormous fortune their parents had left behind when they perished in a horrible fire. Mr. Poe the banker that manages the orphan's money until violet comes of age (18 years old); decided to send the orphans to a boarding school away from count Olaf. The orphans cannot stay in the dorm rooms at the boarding school because they need parent permission, so they live in an old rundown shack with crabs all over the floor. That afternoon at lunch they met another pair of orphans who were us like them and became friends. Later one night before dinner they received a note from count Olaf telling them to meet him on the front lawn. The gym teacher obviously disguised as count Olaf told them to run laps he made them run 9 straight nights until they were flunking their classes. They were going to be expelled if they didn't pass the test. That night the kids came up with a plan. The quagmires would run while the orphans studied for their tests. They got quizzed the next morning as Mr. Poe came to check up on them; they convinced Mr. Poe that the gym teacher was count Olaf he ran away taking the quagmires with him."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
The book was very exiting to read| there was always action going on between Count Olaf and the orphans. That made the book very interesting and kept me reading. The book was very descriptive and made me feel like I was right in the middle of all the action. The conflict of the story is great. Not only is their one main conflict like escaping from count Olaf but there are also a lot of side conflicts. The characters were very well described it felt like I could almost picture them so perfectly I could touch them. The books' ending was a very good one but it was a bit sad when the quagmires got taken away. Overall I thought it was very descriptive and I liked it a lot!|||||||||||
||||||||||||
The author's voice is different from most authors. When he says a big word he always gives an example to help you understand| he also writes a little bit scary but with lots of action. The author's vocabulary is very different than those of others. He uses descriptive and understandable vocabulary| and like I said he always defines the big words. Some unique characteristics of his writing are| he never ever uses any boring words or says any word too many times. He also uses a lot of dialogue and it does help the story a lot with the conversations between characters. His tone is always vivid; you can almost never tell his feelings as he writes but the characters feelings are well described.|||||||||
||||||||||||
I would rate this book very high especially about his descriptiveness| the story is very good and the mood is one you will enjoy. It can be read by kids or adults of any age and I am sure you will like it. I think this book is a book for any type of reader that enjoys a good book.|||||||||||

The monotony seen before was one of my main criticisms for the last book in the series, """"The Wide Window"""". Now, deep into the story we find ourselves in a new situation, since everyone will be asking the question posed in the title of this miserable review, even Snicket himself."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"After the horrible events described in """"The Wide Window"""", the Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus and Sony, find themselves traveling with Mr. Poe towards their next destination / home / workplace / place of torture / unlucky spot. The town to which they arrive is called Paltryville, and right away we receive Snicket's warning about Count Olaf showing up in another disguise. This creates an anticipation that is prolonged longer than usual, creating an avid desire in the reader to get to the climax of this story as quickly as possible."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
The new caretaker of the siblings owns the Lucky Smell lumber mill| a horrid place that has a sign made out of chewed-up gum| pays the employees with coupons| feeds them gum for lunch and is located in a town that has a creepy building in the shape of an eye. As if all this was not enough| the Baudelaire orphans find out upon their arrival that they are expected to work in the mill. That is the deal that Sir| their new guardian| proposes in exchange for protecting them from the evil Count Olaf.||||||
||||||||||||
I found particularly interesting the set of characters presented in this work. Phil is a mill worker that sees life through very optimistic eyes. Foreman Flacutono is a ruthless giant in charge of the workers and who wakes them every morning by banging pots together; this is considerably worse than waking up to the sound of music and having coffee ready waiting for you. Finally| Sir is a very short man who has a cloud of smoke constantly surrounding his face and who is extremely stingy| to say the least.||||||||||
||||||||||||
"The author keeps showing his extremely sharp wit, which produces innumerable humorous situations and interesting conversations. Of course, none of these lead to a good chuckle in the reader, since the siblings keep going through unhappy times. All the elements mentioned create a notable book that will be very difficult to best. Those of you that can stand unhappiness should not pass up the opportunity to read it!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Violet is the 14 year old inventor, Klaus is the almost 12 year old avid reader, and Sunny is the infant with a knack for biting things. Seeing such marvelous children, one might think they led lives of happiness. But it's just the opposite for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. These three children happen to be the most unfortunate children on earth. And even though they might be friendly, it's hard to make a good thing out of a bad situation when you're at The Miserable Mill. The Baudelaire's, after their sad adventure on Lake Lachrymose, have been moved to a new guardian again. This time their caretaker is the head of the Lucky Smells Lumbermill, a place that isn't all that lucky. The children have been left in the care of Mr. Sir, the boss of the mill, who has a cloud of smoke for a head. Mr. Sir, I'm sorry to say, demands the children to work in the mill. Even Sunny must do her share of the labor. But it's not all bad, at least not to the children's new friend Phil who is a strong optimist. And there's Charles too, the friendly assistant to Mr. Sir. Unfortunately, both are such pushovers that they can't really do anything for the Baudelaire's except offer words of encouragement. But sawing the bark off lumber becomes the second worst thing on the Baudelaire's list of bad things, when the children realize that Count Olaf is back, only he doesn't look exactly the same...or rather, she doesn't look exactly the same. And if this wasn't enough, Klaus is suddenly suffering from memory loss, and only Violet can crack the mystery to save her brother and the other Lucky Smells Lumbermill employees before it's too late! All of this leads to one of the most exciting encounters in the whole """"Series of Unfortunate Events"""". Lemony Snicket records another thrilling chapter of the Baudelaire's unfortunate lives. Look out for the pinching machine, long words in a book, people who aren't as they appear, and accidents that just might be fatal. Make sure you have book five and possibly book six handy, as these tales slip past you as quickly as Count Olaf."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Esme Squalor re-appears in disguise at one point, so try to give her a distinct voice which you can imitate in two different accents (as Officer Luciana, I gave here Deep South Accent, whereas as the city's sixth-most important financial advisor she spoke with cut-glass received pronunciation).

Anyway, they meat this really nasty girl named Carmelita Spats who calls them """"cakesniffers"""", and then they meet the Quagmire triplets whose brother died in a fire, (names are Duncan and Isadora), and they help the Baudelairs out. But then Count Olaf, the one nastiest person in Lemony Snicket's fictional world that he has taken the time to in-depthly describe, disguises himself as """"Coach Genghis"""", therefore breaching the school's secutity system by eluding thier """"advanced' computer"""". He makes the Baudelaires paint a luminous circle of glowing paint on the front lawn of the school, and then run laps around the glowing track until morning for several nights, in a little operation he called """"S.O.R.E."""". (Simple Orphan Running Excersizes, I think.) Then for a week or two he does this, and up until thier final exams they started flunking out of lack of sleep, and being very irritable indeed. So on the day of the tests, Duncan and Isadora instead cover for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny by dressing like them and dragging a """"sunny decoy"""" behind them - a bag of flour wearing her bonnet and little pink ribbon. This is so the Baudelaires could stay behind and study. But they get caught, and even though the Baudelaires aced thier tests, they were expelled by Vice principan Nero. Then Olaf walks up, is exposed for who he really is, in short, and then dashes back to his car and revves the engine. As he starts off, the siblings see the Quagmire triplets in the back window. Duncan shouths to Klaus, """"V.F.D."""", and """"in my notebooks!"""", before Olaf snatches the notebooks from Klaus and drives away. But that is for the next book. I liked this book and gave it a five out of five. I think any of you who are on this page for any reason other than that you have simply lost your way among the web would, also. Lemony Snicket, if you ever come to reading this page, THAT BOOK WAS AWESOME!!!!!!! (ahem...sorry.

Well they have to sleep in a orphan shack the thing that I like is that the BAOUDELAIR orphan makes friends that are orphans too. The thing I don’t like about the middle of the story so that they could make more enemies. The evil villain captures something more valuable. I loved that awesome thing happened to them. I wished that they were a little smarter because Violet the oldest was a scientist .Klaus the middle child loved too read when he had free time he would read as much as his brain could take. Sunny was the youngest she had 4# very sharp teeth she loved biting hard teeth.||||||||||||

Like the previous books chronicling the misadventures of three very unlucky orphans, THE MISERALBE MILL contains a gleeful mix of mock gloom and doom, surreal satire (the lastest ineffectual guardian, the blowhard capitalist mill owner known only as """"Sir"""", has an unseen head perpetually covered by a thick cloud of cigar smoke), impossible situations, real suspense, and the author's delightful word play - the last in itself enough reason for grownups to read the books. What sets MILL apart is its more antic than usual plot - think Chuck Jones as influenced by Monty Python (with a dash of Dickens) and you won't be too far off the mark. I laughed out loud at least once every page (whether from the description of the depressing mill dormortory with its windows drawn on in ballpoint pen, Count Olaf's ludicrous disguise, Snicket's side-splitting autobiographical blips, the Warner Bros.cartoonish climax, etc.), and that's not an easy feat for any writer to accomplish. Snicket is a true genius, one of those rare authors whose work succedes on more than one level and is even more appealing to his adult fans - the ones who can get all the jokes.(Example: MILL's wicked optomestrist/hypnotist is named Dr. Georgina Orwell.) Kids can appreciate the fact that most of the adult characters are either too dense or too preoccupied to pay any attention to the real needs of the Baudeliare children, who must fend for themselves when the nutty goings get delightfully rough.

In the previous book, Violet, Klaus and Sunny finally found friends in the presence of the two Quagmire triplets (yes, you read it right...two triplets!). But the joy did not last long, and soon the mischievous Count Olaf kidnapped the Quagmires. Now the orphans have to figure out a way to remain safe, but also have to try to rescue their friends in the process, and the only way to do this is to find Count Olaf and solve the mystery of VFD."||||||||||||

After a journey that has taken them through their fair share of scary and woeful places| the Baudelaires are finally close to their home once more. The problem is that close is not close enough| and Dark Avenue| the street where their new guardians live| is really what the name suggests: a dreadful place. The neighborhood in which the Squalors live is in the dark because dark is in! In the same manner| the elevators are out| and the orphans| the pinstripe suits and the aqueous martinis are in. Even though the orphans are forced to climb the stairs to the apartment of Jerome and Esme Squalor in the dark| either to the forty-eighth or eighty-fourth floor| and all the nonsense they have to put up with about what is in and what is out| they are safe and sound and that is enough to give them some solace. However| they cannot help but feel some fear about what will happen when the orphans are not in anymore.|

"Of course, Count Olaf will show up disguised as usual and bring danger to the world of the Baudelaires, and there will be excitement, happiness and sorrow. Violet will have to show a great deal of her inventing talents, Klaus his ability for research and Sunny the strength of her four teeth. Also as usual, the reader will get a fair amount of excellent entertainment, with Snicket's witty remarks and unusual technique for writing. One aspect of this technique is that when the book starts we are given a preview of what will come, through the use of dictionaries and words in quotes...but I am going to let you figure that one out on your own."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Granatino,""Once again, the three orphans prevail!"",15-Feb-02,""This series of books is as good as it gets - a wonderful read for parents and kids in tandem, as long as everyone knows in advance (gasp) that some character will meet a horrible fate in the end. The three orphans are Sunny, Klaus and Violet, each with a different niche in life. Sunny bites well, Klaus reads well, and Violet invents. Together, they are an awesome combination, and over the course of the series they do everything from cowing dangerous snakes to stealing a boat in a hurricane. I don't want to say more, except that the villain (Count Olaf) is wonderful - a bumbling fool who can never get his dastardly deeds exactly right, and always races off at the end of the book, with a threat that he will come back yet again. I'm through the fourth book, as is my entire family, including my aged mother and my sixth grader, and my mother wanted all the books for her birthday. That is how good these books are. And by the way, they are a great vocabulary tool.. Mr. Snicket explains every fancy word with a hysterical explanation of its meaning. And as Sunny would say, """"Snafoo!"""" (""""Snafoo"""" means, """"I like Mr. Snicket for writing these books, and if you are adventurous, you should buy them."""")"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are happy to be returning to the city where they were born, but they fear for the capture Quagmires, who are at the mercy of Count Olaf, and naturally, they fear Count Olaf has yet another dastardly plan to steal the Baudelaire fortune. And their new guardians aren't doing much to ease their fears. Jerome is kind but naive, and Esme only cares about what's fashionable and what's not. As usual, it's up to the Baudelaires to save themselves from the clutches of the evil Count Olaf and his dastardly accomplices. This was one of my favorite books in A Series of Unfortunate Events.

The Baudelaire orphans have yet another set of guardians, the sympathetic Jeremy Squalor and the superficial Esme Squalor.  Esme is obsessed with what's in and what's out of fashion and seems to spend her entire life attending to this matter.  This obsession provides much of the humor of this book.  Also funny is the Squalor's seemingly endless apartment.  A new mystery presents itself to the orphans, the meaning of VFD, and much of the plot surrounds their efforts to unravel this enigma.  This mystery continues into later books."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Ersatz-Elevator-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064408647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||
