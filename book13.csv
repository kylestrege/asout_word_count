Unsatisfying, but Somehow Expected"",27-Nov-08,""I was initially sorely disappointed that The End did not divulge the secrets that we have been following thirteen books for - but then I understood any ending wouldn't have been able to live up to our expectations. All I can to is reflect on the long and strange journey it's been."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"As the series progressed, so did the complexity and meaning. The first few books were funny and original, but that was it - children's fun, a bit brainless, seemingly. However, as the books went on, it was clear that Handler was slipping in more than just lighthearted whimsicalities - literary allusions, allegories, hidden themes and symbols. The downright cleverness (the hidden symbols! The ironic wit!) of the books astounds me, seriously. I honestly feel that these books ought to be considered """"serious"""" pieces of literature, and analyzed as fitting to their genius."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
But was it more than just cleverness and wit? Judging by half the review on this site| apparently not.||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
However| after reading a few thoughtful posts on the books' fansite| I am now somewhat convinced that the entire series may have had a deeper| symbolic meaning to it - an allegory disguised as a children's read. Here are two possible alternate theories I stumbled upon:||||||||||
|||||||||||||
 has been suggested that the Series has Jewish themes| and indeed that the suffering| guilt| questioning attitude| and constant wanderings of the Baudelaires reflect the plight of the Jewish people. In The End| they find a safe homeland(where their parents had lived)| but at the expense of either killing everyone else or driving them into the sea. Perhaps notably| it is ruled by a man called Ishmael| the name of the alleged ancestor of the Arabs.|||||

And also as taken from one of the fan websites| some of the fine points Snicket/Handler has made in social satire:||||||||||||

 Snicket's Politics and Social Satire - by Antenora|||||||||||||
« Thread Started on Jun 30|2008| 3:54pm »|||||||||||
Mr. Snicket's Politics and Unfortunate Social Satire|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"We know that Daniel Handler is a liberal, and it appears that his character Snicket shares these views, based on the available evidence-- in his letters to Beatrice, he denounces """"pre-emptive war""""(the solution to Olaf's anagram """"a wet viper perm"""") as an obscene concept, and expresses sadness over the fact that two women are not allowed to marry. While we know relatively little about the politics of the Snicket world, by our standards Snicket would also be a liberal. He would also strongly disapprove of the """"anti-elitist"""" and anti-intellectual leanings commonly shown by some conservatives(but by no means limited to the Right-- consider how Hillary Clinton has dismissed the worth of economic experts). For Snicket, this kind of thinking(or non-thinking) goes hand in hand not only with evil, but with sheer absurdity."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Several of the post-V.F.D. books contain notable social satire| presenting a world not entirely unlike our own:||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
1. The obsession with wealth| fashion and conspicuous consumption-- exemplified by the items sold in the aptly named Veblen Hall-- in TEE. Many of these items and fashions| such as keeping whole streets in darkness| climbing dozens of flights of stairs| and parsley soda| would seem unappealing if they were not| for some reason| declared fashionable.||||||
|||||||||||||
"2. The tyrannical government of the Village of Fowl Devotees, which resembles a theocracy or a cult with its devotion to crows, censorship of any suggestion of dissent, and medieval-esque method of punishment. Consider also their puritanical ban on """"using one's mouth for recreation"""", which implies the sort of restriction of sensual pleasure seen in communities ruled by religion. Even these frightening figures have comical aspects, though, with their silly hats, forbiddance of their own rule books, and nitpicking about ice-cream sundaes."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"3. The public's love of humiliation, freakishness, """"violence and sloppy eating"""", shown by the visitors to Caligari Carnival. While people like the pimpled man are exaggerated strawman characters, their means of entertainment are not entirely unrealistic-- witness reality shows, torture-themed movies, media coverage of Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton, certain web pages, and rubberneckers at car accidents."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"4. The corrupt-yet-absurd High Court in TPP. This is the most powerful political institution we see in ASoUE, and it reflects all the worst aspects of this world's authority and society. Members are either unfathomably evil or too """"laissez-faire"""" to hold back evil-- one may draw a parallel to the executive and legislative branches of the current United States government. However, their Scalia-esque interpretation of """"Justice is blind"""", like the crow hats, allows us to laugh as well as tremble."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"5. Ishmael's government of """"Olaf-Land"""", which forms an interesting counterpoint to the Village of Fowl Devotees. Instead of ruling with an iron fist, Ishmael appears gentle(and more sympathetic than the Council of Elders), and his government, while cultish, is more like communism than fascist theocracy. By restricting his subjects' access to knowledge, technology, and most material items, Ishmael attempts to stamp out greed and create a Marxist utopia, which as in our world ultimately turns out to be dystopic. This reflects the """"horseshoe"""" theory of the political spectrum, in which the extreme right and the extreme left are more similar than they'd like to admit; it also supports the themes of moral ambiguity which become prominent in these later books, in which there is no clear path to goodness.

This book drives the message of the entire series home, and is in so many ways an allegory to what we experience every day. I thought this book was more emotional and better written than all of the other books combined, and was pleased with the couple of things we DID find out, even though there are a million other questions left unanswered.

The End|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
By Lemony Snicket|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
This book begins where the penultimate book ended. The Baudelaire orphans are on the ocean with Count Olaf. When a terrible storm washes their boat onto an island| they find a girl named Friday| who takes them to the island facilitator| Ishmael. But| please call him Ish. After a few days| count Olaf returns with a vicious plan to kill off the orphans and everyone on the island.  Will the orphans figure out what to do to save the people on the island? Read the book to find out.||||||||
|||||||||||||
I liked this book a lot because it answers many questions from the other books. It also shows some background on Mr.Snickets past. For example| I learned that he had known the orphan's parents in the past. We also learn whom the author dedicates all of the books to. This book was dedicated to Beatrice. You need to read through the whole book to find out who Beatrice is. I think that is fun. The book was very exciting to read because ever since The Bad Beginning| there have been mystery's unsolved until now. I got so into the book that I bought it in the morning and I finished that evening. The books end gives us the room to imagine what could happen to the Baudlares in the future.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"When I think of whom Lemony Snicket is, I think of a sad man with a sad voice, telling the story of the Baudelaires. He is the author but he is also a main character in the book. I think he is sad because in the book he is always talking about how miserable his life is. He uses the vocabulary in the most amusing of ways. For example, he may teach the kids a new word and say, """"Cordial, which here means to not give a care and will not ever give a care"""".  I think that Mr. Snicket's writing is as funny as it is unfortunate."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Compared to others| I would give this book a 4 out of 5 stars because of its witty sense of humor| great dialogue and great way of answering questions. I highly recommend the whole series.|||||||||||

Smith,""""""Unfortunate"""" is in the title for a reason"",21-Jun-08,""It is unfortunate that I never bothered to write a review for this book early on because I unfortunately assumed that there would be enough competent criticism to help people.  Woefully, I discovered that most of the poor reviews seem to simply be people whining about the fact that it did not end like a Scooby Doo mystery in which the gang unveil the perpetrator and commence to explain various things about the plot they couldn't possibly have known. (But don't rate me unhelpful yet! Just read a little bit further!)"|||||||||||||

If you would prefer the above scenario and were never once bored by the fact that Scooby and the gang solved every single case in the same manner and in the same amount of time| this book IS (probably) NOT for you| plain and simple.

And every time you find a new answer| two more questions arise| making it a Hydra of a conundrum and unbelievably frustrating to some.||||||||

"If you do not mind philosophical, thought-provoking endings that do not tie all the loose ends into pretty little bows, this book IS for you.  """"The End"""" is Snicket's most adult book of the series.  All the children I know who've read it loved it, but they did not catch all of the darker tones to the story, as is true of the entire series.  The final book is titled in an ironic sense, as it is not really the end at all but a new beginning, and it is meant to be a more serious reflection of life.  There will NEVER be a neat little book with all the answers in it for you.  It would not be a series of unfortunate events if that were the case."|||||||||||||

But when I finished the book| I realized that Lemony Snicket was also resisting peer pressure from his readers and from other authors of long juvenile book series. The pressure to have a happy ending. The pressure to tie up all of the loose ends in a nice neat package. The pressure to answer all the obscure questions that arose in previous books. The answers don't magically appear all at once in real life| and the same can be said in this book.|||||||||||

Who is the father of Kit Snicket's baby? Could it be Count Olaf? He did give her a kiss just before she died and referred to a shared history with her.|||||||||||||

The books reflect life. Instead of a happy, easy world in which everything turns out happy and easy, Snicket gives us a picture of real life, where, yes, things are """"okay"""" in the end, but there were many hardships and sacrifices along the way. Like real life, we are left not knowing everything, we don't have all the answers, all we can do is stick with what we know and make the best of it. We just have to keep trying."|||||||||||||

Maybe confused is not the right word here but, I had a little trouble remembering what happened in prior books since it has been a while that I read them. I was optimistically looking forward to a happy ending for the Baudelaire orphans after all the unfortunate events they've encountered since their parents perished. The end of The End felt, to me, a bit unresolved. I still have lots of questions that went unanswered and I'm not sure I'll ever get answers. But at the end of the day, I do love this series. I feel like I understand the core meaning of the books.

For once they seem to have good luck - there is an island nearby and the people living there say the Baudelaire's can live with them, but quickly see what Count Olaf is really like and banish him from the island. But things never run smoothly for the Baudelaires and they soon discover it's difficult to live under the rule of Ishmael who is in charge of the island.

"I thought """"The End"""" was one of the best books in this thirteen book series.

Sunny no longer uses much baby talk, but Snicket still has fun with her words, sometimes using them backward. As in all the books, the children are, for the most part, smarter and more responsible than the adults around them are."|||||||||||||

"Readers may be disappointed to find out that while Snicket ties up several loose ends from the previous books, he leaves some major plot lines dangling.

I can understand the criticism applied to The End. I think that people might have been fooled (like I was) by the genre. Books marketed for children are supposed to be pretty safe reads. Everything's wrapped up and makes sense in the end. Perhaps the genre made people expect this.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
But| in way of defense| I do think that sort of safe ending would have tarnished the series. Clearly| part of the message the books send is that the world doesn't always seem to make perfect sense. Life| at times| can be cruel and ugly. Injustice persists. Evil exists| and it's not even always easy to perceive the difference between evil and good. In other words| unfortunate events happen. Things are not all going to be wrapped up at the end. But despite all of this| the books also argue| there is still such thing as beauty and nobility and justice and love. And with the characteristics the Baudelaires display--courage| honesty| creativity| forgiveness| loyalty--the good may be perceived and pursued in the midst of a mercurial world.

"Had all of the mysteries been answered at the end of the series, the author would have undercut this message. He would have been no better than Ishmael, attempting to give his readers a depiction of a falsely safe world and leaving them less prepared to face the inevitable unfortunate events of life. In the end, the author, thankfully, isn't willing to provide such false shelter, and instead, he offers a challenge for the reader to live as courageously as the Baudelaires."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

They were in a ship, traveling with their arch enemy, Count Olaf, who you could have considered as kidnaping the Baudelaires.  They faced a terrible storm and became ship wrecked.  The island was the place that they thought was the last safe place.  For a while..."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
 The book is full of excitement and misery.  It's really interesting.  You really have to look close in each page and find all the clues.  The whole think is a mystery to another.  Try and solve the mystery first before the story ends.  I always do that.  In this one in particularly| at the end it stops so suddenly you think| Give me more!  And yet if you read closely you would slowly understand how everything now ties together and many questions that you had in the other books in the series have disappeared.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||
 The books suspense catches you and Lemony Snicket's warning in the first few pages in all the Events books always catches my attention.  He always warns you to drop the book if you do not want a miserable ending book and go pick something else| like...In my opinion| Dr. Seuss and his happy| cheerful stories.  No these books have barely any good news and if good news came along| soon something bad would happen.  There are barely any happy endings too.  Though many people enjoy happy and not sad endings| anyone would probably like this.  Like me| I usually read happy endings| like anyone else does| but I read this and I wanted more.  It's just really exiting with all the misery and suspense.  I mean| it's a story about three orphans on the run from the law| misery and villains.  The thing I love the most is that Lemony Snicket has related this to him (though Lemony Snicket isn't his real name and this story is fictional) I just love the parts like Kit Snicket as his sister and Jacques Snicket as his brother and Kit's child named after a person Lemony Snicket has loved.  It all ties together in the end.|||
|||||||||||||
" Really, if you like suspense and misery you have got to read this book.  This book is one of the best I've read.  It's really interesting and so full of clues.  It's just such an enjoyment for me and I'm sure it's true for others too.  Try a new type of book for once.  It might feel good once in a while, I'd say."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

But since when has this series left things all tied up in a nice and neat little package for us?  It is far more likely to leave things hanging, precarious and uncertain, and so The End ends in much the same way.  Things are left uncertain and most questions go unanswered.  The Baudelaires know that """"...you can't read every story, and answer every question..."""" (p. 218, The End).  Questions lead to more questions, not always answers, and there are stories within stories, a theme often repeated in the book and true to life.  However, it is also true that you get some answers you weren't expecting to questions you never thought of."|||||||||||||

I had read interviews with the author in which he said he was often approached at signings by children who had various personal difficulties and identified with the Baudelaires in their search for meaning and for something better, something he had not really anticipated and which he took to heart.  So the message of The End, I think, is really a message to the children who confided in Handler and to others in similar situations--that bad things happen, and sometimes there are no clear answers to why they happen and no way to undo them, but we have to continue to try to overcome our situations anyway and appreciate the good things that do happen.  The allusion to Genesis reminds us that trying to explain why bad things happen is as old as humanity.  If you approach the book in this way, Handler did a remarkable, even heroic, job."|||||||||||||

"By the way, I believe the poster in The Beatrice Letters shows a scene after the end of the End, which that text describes in a somewhat vague manner.

"While I will admit that Handler's usual use of puns, anagrams, word definitions, etc. wasn't quite as prevalent in this book (unfortunate, as it didn't quite feel like his writing style without them), there were some moments that were incredibly laugh-out-loud funny. The snake bringing the apple out of the tree to the orphans? Brilliant. The fact that Handler picked the native animals of the island to be a herd of sheep was also very fitting and perhaps a reference that some people might have missed. The fact that the large sea shape ended up being called the Great Unknown was hilarious, and the """"About the Author"""" where at first glance, one suspects they've finally seen Snicket is brilliant."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Furthermore| while this book remained fantastical in the sense that the world was somewhat absurd| the general ideas were true to life: many of the major and very important mysteries were addressed and answered| but some still remained. When in life are all our questions ever fully and satisfactorily addressed? For those who missed it| the sugar bowl issue was wrapped up in the Penultimate Peril| where the taxi driver that offered to save the Baudelaires after the death of Dewey Denouement had it on the seat next to him in the cab| thus whisking it out of their lives and on to new adventures. The meaning of V.F.D.| while given to us in the Slippery Slope| is confirmed. The questions opened up by the Beatrice Letters (which should probably be read before this book) were all adequately answered.|||||

"All in all, I think that this was the perfect and appropriate ending to the series: I was worried from the cover that the end of the end would be horribly filled with misfortune, which ended up not being the case at all. Certainly, the end wasn't positive, but a positive ending would have been a huge disappointment.

Thus, on Friday, October 13, a day brilliantly planned by the author and perhaps not-so-brilliantly rememembered as the day when many were killed in search of history, the book brings forth a conclusion (If you are curious about this murder because of history, research the Knights Templar).

"The book starts off, as always, where the last one (""""The Penultimate Peril"""") left off - with the Baudelaires at sea with their arch-enemy, Count Olaf. When they find land, the polite Baudelaires are quickly accepted into the island community - ruled by the cordial Ishmael - while Count Olaf, with his unruly manners, is rejected. The island seems like a quiet retreat for the Baudelaires, and even possibly a nice safe haven - for a change. But many mysteries and secrets seem to lurk on the island, and once again the Baudelaires are caught up in the middle trying to discover more. The island calls for some interesting scenes and situations, and a few (though this isn't new) frustrating characters."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
The first complaint seems to be the lack of (apparently expected) revelations in the book. Apparently| not enough secrets were revealed. Tsk-tsk| how dare Lemony Snicket keep us in the dark for twelve books| just to NOT reveal anything yet again? I don't pretend to know Handler's exact intentions with this book| but what I can imagine is how absurd it would be to uphold the secrecy for 156 chapters| just to throw it all away in the space of a few hundred pages. I mean| really| imagine how lame it would have been for him to just give everything away. In my opinion it would ruin the spirit of the series. I think the whole point was to have lots of mysteries| some of which having a solution (if searched between the lines enough) and some staying a topic of speculation.|||||
|||||||||||||
A Series Of Unfortunate Events has been one of the only series of books about which you can sit and think and speculate and in fact MARVEL. Okay sure| maybe some more answers would have been satisfying| but it would have killed the imagination. It would have killed VFD| and the Baudelaire parents| and the people they were involved with and Lemony Snicket himself.|||||||||
|||||||||||||
"I liked """"The End"""" because it was different to the other books - you saw a very strange side of Count Olaf, and although it is the end of the series, it marks a new beginning for the Baudelaire orphans, the Baudelaires grow up, and, they discover an important part of their parents' past."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"I think the few questions that were answered in """"The End"""" were enough to explain a whole lot of other questions raised in previous books, but not too much to dampen our still-going speculations."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"I think the true beauty of """"A Series Of Unfortunate Events"""" lies in its mystery, its sadness, its nobility and its ability to waken the curiosity in a person, and all of these things feature wonderfully in the moving """"The End""""."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"The End"""" is a definite must-read for fans of the series, and I recommend you keep in mind the other books when you read it - do not have expectations unlikely to be fulfilled by such a secretive author, but appreciate it for what it is - a touching end to a fantastic series of books."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

This is a very sophisticated series--one that seems to have grown more sophisticated with each passing book.  This makes this allegory an excellent book for parents to share with intermediate and older children through a shared or serial reading.  There is a lot in the book to spark contemplation and to turn that into a conversation between child and parent.  And conversation and contemplation between parent and child are among the best ways that parents have to keep children safe| after all.  This book is a great segue to that process| whether or not you ultimately agree with the premise of the book.|||||||||||

The final book in """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" contains all the elements, such as humor and wit, that have made the previous twelve books such a success.  But if readers are expecting """"The End"""" to bring an end to the misfortune that the Baudelaires face, they should know better than to think it would all be all summed up so tidily."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"The reader finds Violet, Klaus and Sunny right where they were at the end of """"The Penultimate Peril"""" - adrift at sea with Count Olaf at the helm, still after their fortune and expecting them to be his servants or henchmen.  A violent storm finds them washed up on an isolated island commune that seems to be the ideal safe place - the residents can see through Olaf's veneer and he becomes a outcast.  The Baudelaires are finally safe, or are they?  For things are not all that they appear to be on this island commune, with a leader who is hiding many secrets from his followers that he would rather keep hidden and tries to prevent the orphaned siblings from discovering.  Yet curious as ever, Violet, Klaus and Sunny uncover the dark truth behind the island's community, and its own connection with their parents.  However, while they do uncover some secrets, many more are left unanswered."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"The End"""" may initially seem like a letdown, especially for readers who were hoping for a tidy summation.  While a bit overly long, it is nevertheless as entertaining as the previous novels in the series.  And while this reader was hoping just a little (like many others) that all the mysteries would be solved, the ambiguous ending leaves room for the story to continue."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

My biggest frustration was the Baudelaires, and Count Olaf himself, seemed to be background players for the majority of the book, and that instead of the heart-pounding action that occurred during the previous twelve books (with a few minor exceptions), this was becoming a very literate caution tale, filled with far too much of Handler's typical run-on sentences that can sometimes last for two pages. Some of them, toward the end of The End, nearly made me throw the book down in frustration."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"I appreciated the literary references to The Tempest, Moby Dick, Animal Farm, and other works of fiction written by the so-called """"dead white males"""" (appropriate for this story, by the way), but thought that Handler had written himself into such a convoluted corner with so many strings dangling from the ceiling that it was impossible for him to tie them all up in a satisfactory fashion. As the end to The End approached, and as the remaining number of pages dwindled and dwindled, my exasperation with Handler's in-your-face narration magnified - because nothing was really happening."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Then I realized I had made a very| very| very big mistake.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"The previous book was titled The Penultimate Peril, and some rather sensational events occurred in The Hotel Dénouement. One definition of dénouement is """"the final part of a play, film, or narrative in which the strands of the plot are drawn together and matters are explained or resolved; the climax of a chain of events, usually when something is decided or made clear: i.e., I waited by the eighteenth green to see the denouement."""" A climax, remember, is never the end of the story. There always follows resolution."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
(There could be some rather spirited debate on the fact that The Hotel Denouement was burned to the ground| with specific regard to its meaning...)||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
That I knew what the word meant while reading the book| and still expected The End to provide me with answers all neatly tied up and presented in a package made me feel a bit silly. First| Handler *never* does that sort of thing. He always packages his story in clues boxed in clues boxed in clues. Second| the climax/denouement already occurred| so all that was left was the resolution. There would be no breakneck action as there had been in previous books. There would be a resolution. In all of literature that I'm familiar with| the resolution is always written at approximately the pace that The End was written at (minus all of Handler's witticisms).||||||||
|||||||||||||
The End provided us with resolution. And it did so brilliantly. There were dangling issues - such as the fate of the Quagmires and others that I won't mention here - but the central mysteries were resolved in typical Daniel Handler fashion.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Were we really expecting Count Olaf to| as in so many unsatisfactory villains do| explain to the Baudelaire's every single mystery that had come to that point? That would have been incredibly *un*satisfactory.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"It appeared that Handler was creating new mysteries. That's arguable, because as he """"appeared"""" to be creating new mysteries, he was, in case we hadn't figured them out before, resolving (resolution...) others. And if anyone had yet to figure it out, at the very end he answered the most essential mystery: who/what or is/are Beatrice?"|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
My only beef with the book| which quickly died away| was that I felt if you didn't read The Beatrice Letters| the *full* brilliance of what Handler was doing with the identity of Beatrice (whoever or whatever that is or was) was impossible to grab (I did say *full* brilliance). I felt that readers shouldn't have to read a book that's technically outside of the series to get a broader| more complete understanding of what's happening.|||||||||
|||||||||||||
Then my appreciation for Handler grew. I realized that he didn't simply write a thirteen book series| he created a complete and fully believable universe. There aren't many writers who have done so| and done so with such remarkable success. He wasn't milking us by writing an unauthorized biography| or The Beatrice Letters| he was expanding the believability and reality of his creation. He was also giving us more clues to the essential mysteries| perhaps in case we missed the dozens of clues he cleverly planted right underneath our noses that often went unnoticed.||||||||
|||||||||||||
That said| reading The Beatrice Letters or the biography isn't necessary| and it's quite possible that many people who have rated this book highly haven't read either. You can still appreciate Handler's genius within the confines of the thirteen books| and you can still solve all of the essential mysteries. I solved one that I didn't think was a mystery after I turned the last page. At least| I'm pretty sure I did. With Handler| it's difficult to know sometimes.||||||||

Still, I decided to be as impartial as possible while reading it. I found the usual quirkiness and overly literal humor that I have come to love so much, as well as characters that completely refuse to do anything other than conform and a Count Olaf more endearing with every page. Eventually, though, I realized I was coming to the end of The End, and I couldn't help but notice that hardly anything had been done to satisfy my curiosity."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"Then came Chapter the Fourteenth. A chapter to add more confusion to the series, especially read alongside the artwork done in The Beatrice Letters. But the unexpected happened--the book ended, very little was explained, and I loved it. It didn't matter that I still had no idea what the significance of the sugar bowl was. All that mattered was that Lemony Snicket left me entirely complacent.

Having read The End, I have come to understand some things that I believe LS is trying to convey.  The world is so full of stories, of evil, of good, and of people who are made up of all three, that to try to know all of it is impossible and not the point.  It is obvious that the Baudelaire orphans have done bad things, but most of us believe that, when all is said, they are really good people.  However, we have read 13 books which have explained that to us.  Count Olaf, on the other hand, we have believed (and maybe many people will still believe) that he is pure wickedness.  In my opinion, the third book complicates that thought immensely.  He says it himself that he, too, has lost important things in his life - """"my parents, my true love, my henchfolk, an enormous amount of money I didn't earn, even the boat with my name on it"""" (The End, 312).  And even though we laugh at the ridiculousness of what he says, and for that matter, at the ridiculousness found in all 13 books, it is sad to learn that Olaf is an orphan too and that he has perhaps experienced just as much hardship as the Baudelaires, and as everyone has."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"I could describe how much I like the dark and witty humor or the storytelling, but I will just quickly say how much I was moved when I realized what the biq question mark-shaped object was that even Olaf was afraid of in the 12th book - the Great Unknown.  A.k.a. death.  Kit tells the Baudelaire orphans how the Quagmires and the Widdershins were """"either swallowed up or rescued by that mysterious thing"""" (The End, 305).  It got me thinking about the theme of death in the series, which has a constant presence.  Most of the time, it's cloaked in descriptions of horrible sadness.  Just how many orphans have been mentioned, anyway?  However, I think the Baudelaire's decision to go deal with the world and leave the island shows that death does not have to control them.  In the end, everyone will die, which is either a blessing or a curse, but in the mean time, the world will always spin and continue to add secret upon secret, and the people who live the stories will continue them."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
All in all| after reading this final book| I cannot help but hope for the Baudelaires and feel sympathy for characters like Olaf.  That is not to say I think he turned out to be a saint and earned his halo and wings..after all| he was very villainous.||||||||||

I began last summer reading these books out loud to my 10 and 16 year old boys.  They were immediately hooked on the humor, language and mystery of Lemony Snicket as was I (their mom).  We were not let down in the least by The End.  Mr. Snicket answered most of our questions and the ones he didn't answer lead to very interesting conversations in our home.  I think the whole point was to insite conversation between parents and children.  Many good lessons can be learned from the lives of the Baudelaire children.  We especially liked how the siblings loved one another and was willing to sacrifice for each other (something we try and teach in our home).  Our vocabulary has improved, our sense of humor has become a little warped and over the past several months we have found ourselves in situations where we use a phrase from one of Mr. Snicket's books and laugh knowingly with each other, """"Man, this is Hobson's choice,"""" But that is what makes the books fun.  The hip phrase in our home right now is, """"It depends on how you look at it.""""  And is most certainly does!  Mr. Snicket you are very talented indeed.  You make language """"magic""""!

This novel leaves readers with more questions and more hanging ends than before, yet hints throughout the series and throughout The End indicate that the answers COULD be there if one looks hard enough. My online searches for answers did not turn up anything more conclusive than what I had come up with, yet some readers thought that these hints point to a set of conclusions that other readers disagree with. I have to conclude that most readers can easily pick out these """"clues"""" but some of us are hesitant to jump to the conclusions that others so readily embrace. Overall, the series is delicious and enjoyable, but don't read The End expecting to tie the series up in a neat little bow, a complete and understandable package.

I am astonished by all the reviewers who expressed their disappointment at this book's lack of story answers. I would think that most people would have figured out by book 11 or so that this series was not about making sense| or answering questions. That was part of its wacky appeal. Such readers seemed to have missed the author's point and underlying themes (probably the same people who were disappointed at the ending of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy - which was the natural outgrowth of the entire saga). I myself approached this book expecting NO answers| and if a reader does this| I believe they too will be pleasantly surprised.||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"The End"""" not only contains a coherent plot, with a beginning, middle and end (something recent books in the series have lacked), it contains many clever allegories woven into the narrative (including """"taking the apple from the serpent to gain a not-necessarily desirable life""""), and several surprisingly adult medidations on philosophical issues."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"I can only suppose that reviewers who felt the book lacked merit completely missed these bits of brilliance, and, by doing so, missed Daniel Handler's (aka Lemony Snicket) point in his story of the Baudelaire orphans and their trevails: that the world does not always make sense, that the choice between good and evil is not so clear, and that our choices often have consequences we did not intend, but ones which we must nonetheless live with. But we face this world, """"The End"""" tells us, because then and only then can we make it a better place. Depression, denial and running away are not options - they are excuses - which the orphans nevers use, despite every reason to. Kudos to Handler for placing these important truths in a a children's work."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"And the book STILL managed to throw in many laugh-out-loud lines (e.g., at one point, when the orphans are skimming a book for vital information, the narrator remarks that when one does skim a book, one tends to get a rather garbled impression of its contents, particularly since some authors like to throw in random sentences to throw off and confuse skimmers. The next sentence in the book, smack-in-the-middle of a life-and-death situation, is """"Three very short men carried off a large door, painted to resemble a large living room"""", after which, without missing a beat, the story continues. Genius.)."|||||||||||||

"Don't buy this book expecting answers - that's like buying Kant expecting something like The Da Vinci Code - instead, buy it expecting laughs, ideas, and maybe a few tears, and you won't be disappointed."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

Here's a final volume of a 13-book series that's full of mysteries, conspiracies, unanswered questions, and unknown fates...and it gives us almost no answers at all, instead leaving both us and the characters to live with the questions and try to make their own lives beyond the boundaries of this series. It's a bold move, but it's in keeping with the rest of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, which has always been less interested in its plot and more interested in turning its simple story into something more profound and complex than you expected. By the end of the final volume, villains get a chance at redemption, heroes fall pitifully, leaders fail their people, and the book becomes more and more fascinatingly symbolic, becoming - in some ways - a meditation on death and the unknowns in each of our lives. That's heady stuff for just about any book, much less a children's book series, but it's part of what made me love the Snicket books so much, and part of what I love as an English teacher about the set - what better way to introduce children to complex concepts and postmodern literature that comments on itself, experiments with its form, and shatters its fourth wall so many times that it becomes non-existent. But as much as I love a lot about The End, I can't deny that the main story of the book - which involves an island community - is an odd one that feels a bit like filler or an afterthought, disconnected from the rest of the series and essentially a bit disconnected even from some of the themes and ideas at work throughout the rest of the book. Still, I love The End - I love how odd it is, and how much Snicket is willing to risk angering people to deliver the ending that the series deserves, one that embraces the mystery at its core rather than unraveling it. And it does it all while still being funny, gleefully odd, wonderfully complicated, and surprisingly emotionally moving. A good ending to a great series, and one whose gutsiness elevates the series as a whole to something more than the sum of its parts."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

At last, 'The End'"",22-Oct-06,""My 11 year old son and I just finished 'The End.' I had been reading it to him over the past few days since its publication and he would occasionally take it to bed with him, unable to wait until the next evening's reading. I, of course, had finished it days before, at least as eager as he to find out what happened."|||||||||||||

It is not at all what was to be expected. 'The End' is as different from 'The Bad Beginning' and the others which followed as can rightly be expected from the likes of Lemony Snicket.|||||||||||||

"My son's comment this evening, unable to stop after beginning Chapter Twelve, was, """"Oh, Daddy, it is so sad,"""" which echoed my feelings exactly. The Baudelaire Orphans have had to grow up so quickly and have given up so much in the process. Doubtless Mr. Snicket would have a good laugh at any idea that his 13 volume joke could be taken seriously, or worse, evoke feelings of empathy for his outrageous characters and situations, but at least for me and my son, that is exactly what happened. We lived the Baudelaire's lives and ultimately reaped the very bittersweet rewards that they did."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
'A Series of Unfortunate Events' achieves nothing less than the exact opposite of what its author (perhaps) set out to do. A literary joke that gradually evolves into a minor masterpiece of dark humor and a subtle - and sometimes not-so-subtle - investigation of the human heart.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Snicket's wordplay and encyclopedic knowlege of many things| continue unabated in this latest and last volume of the series. His names and jokes on literary names connected to islands (Caliban| Pitcairn| Bligh| etc.) alone will keep my son and I busy for a long time.

Lemony Snicket had a lot to answer, more than I thought he would be able to. Would I be satisfied with this book as I had been by the other 12? Or would he cop out in the end?"|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
In the end| I was finally able to say: Snicket provided the best end to any series I've read for a long time.||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Not because he answered everything| that is. We still never find out some of the things that have been irking us since the beginning. What is the Snicket file? How about the sugar bowl? Neither question is answered. Rather| the genius here lies in HOW we're denied information| rather than that nothing was answered.||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Nobody knows all the secrets| we are told. Every time we've been told something| two new questions pop up. Ishmael| the literary allusion that serves as our guide to this story| knows many stories ALMOST like the ones we know| but not quite. Even in the last few pages| we're given more questions to ponder. But as Snicket warns the readers| no story is ever entirely over. The Baudelaires go on living past THE END| not happily ever after but entirely as they had gone on before. Lives begin| and lives end. The one scene that disappointed me the most - one where a large group of characters die for almost no reason| or so it seems - made sense in retrospect: they are lost to the Great Unknown| just as so many are.||
|||||||||||||
"For those people worrying about the story itself, fear not: it has everything you've come to expect. Olaf comes back in disguise, and has one of his funniest - and most thought-provoking - moments yet. The library in this story is greater than any we've seen so far. Best of all, Handler (Snicket, that is) is at his finest in terms of wordplay, almost trumping his adult work Adverbs. THE END is a fitting end to the Series, though it is also a beginning of sorts.

The setting of this story makes for a rather slow plot progession at times, but it does allow Snicket to show his flair for the English language. The main themes of the book are 1. There are many layers to a story 2. It depends on how you look at things and 3. Sometimes a word can have two meanings (such as cordial the drink, cordial the demeanor). These themes also apply to the entire book Series. The 13 books presented by Snicket only represent the Baudelaires story, and some questions are not answered in this book because it is another layer within the story. But, you do find out many answers, such as what happened to the Quagmires, what V.F.D. stands for, and who is (are) Beatrice.  HINT: V.F.D. and Beatrice have two meanings.  You can also figure out, if you read carefully, how Lemony is known to the Baudelaires' mother. Snicket does his duty of reporting the events of the orphans, and leaves it open for himself to report more on the many characters in the many layers of the V.F.D. Let's hope he does!Also, the illustrator, Brett Helquist, does a magnificent job of illustrating this and the other books in the series."|||||||||||||

That they have a life after the story ends is clear, and it is not necessary to know what that is. There is some sadness, some happiness, and some reasons to wonder about what would have happened next. It is a sign of a great novel that you are thinking and wondering about the characters after the story is over.

"In Modern life, Books, films, and other media devices always have happy endings where everything is revealed. The suspense in these stories comes from who dies along the way. In The End, Lemony Snicket/Daniel Handler rejects society and releases a story that doesn't tie up the loose ends at all. It ends well, and players feel a sort of closure when Olaf dies. Other than that, the series could continue forever in the same format as before. The kids don't learn much at this point, but I thought it was an amazing ending, to have their mother be Beatrice. it adds importance to almost everything said in previous books about her, and I'm sure Die Hard readers will be checking the old books trying to glean any extra information about Beatrice that might help them gain further understanding. That being said, it's a great way to get people to sell books, as well as being a perfect final twist. Daniel Handler proves to be a very good author writing content which, if you ask me, is a bit beneath his ability, if not his creative voice. I'm very excited to see what he comes out with in the future as I hope this is the beginning of a great career."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

I've been reading these books for years now and have always appreciated the duplicity of these books and the puzzle they present for the reader.  It's almost a throwback (probably intentionally) to the double nature of Renaissance literature.  I wouldn't say (because I haven't found enough evidence to prove this) that they are any sort of full-fledged allegory but double-meanings are highly prevalent in these books.  In other words, as another reader above mentioned, a sheep is not just a sheep.  The point is, this isn't just about some kids who get shipwrecked on an island and it's not in any way boring (at least for someone who """"gets"""" it).  It's a highly mature exploration of human nature and the basic moral conflicts and problems that every human being faces in some way or another.  Life isn't cut and dry, there is no black and white but only a mass of grey.  Books with sugary sweet happy endings are all well and good but, as far as children's lit goes (and all lit for that matter), the stories that cut to the heart and have the most meaning are those such as these books that leave a certain amount of moral ambiguity and really deal with humanity not some escapist concoction.  That's why I think these make wondrous children's books (not even I would rank Handlers cumbrous prose as high literature), not only do they familiarize kids with literary concepts (deus ex machina, memento mori and the like) and through profuse allusions with many of the world's greatest literary works, they refuse to fool children into thinking that life is easy, boy meets girl and everything eventually works out for the righteous and true at heart.  As we all discover at some point, life doesn't work that way.  All we have, like the Baudelaire children at the end of the end, is each other and our dignity.  From this perhaps we can cobble a life and a world worth living in."|||||||||||||

Without spoiling anything, all that I'll say is that the harpoon gun and the Medusoid Mycelium return, and that there's a Chapter 14 (epilogue).  Plus, a friend from one of the earlier books is back - but you'll NEVER guess who!! Lastly, let me tell you that at a certain part of the story, there's a Biblical reference that is very interesting to see how Daniel Handler/Lemony Snicket portrays in literature.  I think that's it's safe to say that The End was very expecteded by all Snicket fans, but that there was a bit of disappointment when people actually read the book.  Well, as far as I know, it's all based on opinion becasue even though some people hated the book, others (including myself) enjoyed it even more than the other twelve!  True, the sugar bowl mystery was not resolved, but clues in other books hint to its contents.  The VFD mystery is in fact solved, but the reader must pay close attention to what Lemony Snicket says.  When you get to the end of the book, the identity of Beatrice is the best you'll love to read because it was so unpredictable (although The Beatrice Letters (A Series of Unfortunate Events) gives you clues).  Overall, if you've read all of the books in the series - do not even think twice about reading this one...just do!  The cover says it all: this is a very """"unfortunate"""" book.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT (specially Count Olaf's hilarious and unique disguise)!  One more thing: Kit Snicket gives birth (I am not sure whether this is a spoiler or not becasue it was kind of obvious that it would happen in the last book, but it was still worth mentioning).

Of course we knew that Olaf would kick the bucket| ultimately the orphans are now much safer.  Do all the bad guys pay and go to jail?

There are other companion books for the franchise beyond this one, but for the most part the series ends here."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
We start right after the events of The Penultimate Peril with the Baudelaires sharing a boat with Count Olaf as they escape the events at the Hotel Denouement. A fierce storm brings them to an unusual island that takes the Baudelaire children but reject Count Olaf due to his attitude and vile threats. They are later joined by Kit Snicket| who has somehow floated over on a pile of books together with the Incredibly Deadly Viper from The Reptile Room.||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
After all the excitement and terror of recent events| the Baudelaire children start to find actual rest and comfort on this peaceful island with its helpful little community. Sure things seem specifically crafted to maintain a particularly bland tone of life but boring means less danger| right? But over time they find that a lot of the rules that had been put in place feel oddly restricting to the point of being counter productive| especially given their naturally inquisitive minds. How long can they remain on the island and avoid the troubles of the outside world?||||||||||
|||||||||||||
What I Liked: The drastic shift in tone for this book versus all the others was rather jarring at first as any other book would end with some some of big confrontation with the villain who has chased and tormented our heroes for so long. But instead we start with the villain sharing the same boat with them and yet being left out by the odd island community from the very beginning. They don't even get fooled by another of his disguises that had fooled so many others across all the past titles. And this made for a very interesting setting to start the last part of this greater story.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
And there are so many lessons brought forward in this book as a culmination of all that had come before. Everything that the Baudelaires had experienced across the series became rather important in this final chapter yet also irrelevant to how the characters would eventually move forward. This is more than just a story of good versus evil. And that's where the genius of this book really lies as it gives a new layer of meaning on top of everything that had come before.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
What Could Have Been Better: That said| the unusual direction of the final book can lead to some disappointment over how things resolve. You want that big finale between the two sides of V.F.D. and to maybe get a clean resolution to everyone's character arcs. But we don't get that sort of an ending and while one cannot argue if the actual ending was better or worse that sort of expectation| it was certainly different and surprising.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||
And I'm not sure how onboard I was for how we ended with yet another group of people we didn't know with their own set of problems that to some degree need to be resolved or at least dealt with just like all the other books despite things coming to a close. So that initial part that felt too much like when the Baudelaire children first being brought to a new group of people who could possibly take care of them and that| like many of the past delays revealing more about V.F.D.| felt like a bad call. It makes sense later on but at first it felt odd and jarring.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||
"TL;DR: The End is a great ending to the series which I suppose can be a little controversial for some. But if you get past that shock, the book has a lot of great moments and things that even re-contextualize past adventures in a great new, and perhaps philosophical, light."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/End-Unfortunate-Events-Book-13/product-reviews/0064410161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||

If you were expecting answers and didn't get it| you would have to look really carefully. Either that or you didn't read the whole series. And the sugar bowl thing was quite obvious anyways and didn't need to be added to the story.||||||||||||

The end of the End is the beginning of the beginning of the middle to the end of all schism| but it is certainly not the end in the end of the Baudelaire's life because the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the mysteries of their lives are at the beginning of the beginning of all schism| and will end in the end of the end of all their next generations. So nothing can have a beginning or an end| but it can have a start and a denouement. LOL.||||||||||

After escaping the fire at the Hotel Denouement| the Baudelaires find themselves at sea with Count Olaf.  Due the great schism| the V.F.D. has been divided into good and evil factions.  The fire was a result of the orphans escape from the hotel; the last safe place.|||||||||||

After surviving  a horrible storm| the Baudelaires and the Count| are washed up on the coastal self| along with a fantastic array of flotsam.||||||||||

An island is nearby.  This island is inhabited by people who desire simple life in peace and safety| far away from the dangers and treachery of the outside world.||||||||||||

"The island is ruled by a facilitator who uses peer pressure to ensure that no one """"rocks the boat."""""|||||||||||||

The orphans choose to live on the island.  They especially appreciate the fact that the islanders will not allow Olaf on the island.|||||||||||||

But the safety and security of the island comes at a price.  There are secrets.  When the islanders decide to mutiny| some spores of the deadly Medusoid Mycelium fungus (From the Grim Grotto) are released every one on the island must make a life or death decision.||||||||||||

At The End| we learn the truth about the orphans' parents. We learn about Kit Snicket.  And we learn about the narrator| Lemony Snicket.|||||||||||

Firstly, I have no idea how he does it, but Snicket/Handler managed to pull off a terriffic feat; that is, writing a 13 installment series of books that never dulls, never lags, and constantly suprises.  Not many authors can do that - most series start with a bang and end with a whimper, as the author loses steam and begins to lag in creativity.  ASoUE, however, manages not to fall into this trap, and, instead, had a rousing end.  I must admit that 'The End' was the only book in the series that actually made me depressed (slightly) and almost tearful (then again, I get teary at some pretty interesting things).  However, it really was touching seeing this series come to an end.  And yes, I really do believe that this is the last book in the series.  Perhaps Snicket will delight us with another book akin to 'UA' or 'BL' to clear up a few things (wouldn't you love an 'Unoffical Guide to V.F.D.'?)  but as for the 'canon', I truly believe that it is finished.  Having said that, I will also warn readers that this review does contain spoilers - and lots of them, so if you don't want it ruined, don't read this."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
My second surprise is the number of negative reviews here.  For those wondering| yes| Snicket does answer TONS of questions| including 1. Who is Beatrice? 2. What does VFD stand for? 3. What is the point of 'The Beatrice Letters'?  I think he also tells what was inside the sugar bowl| as well as what happens to the Quagmires.  Also| (and this is just my opinion) but I'm pretty certain that it was Dewey and Kit| not Olaf and Kit.|||||||
|||||||||||||
Like all good/great series| the 'bad guys' get their just desserts| and although good does not necessarily 'triumph over evil'| the moral compass reigns true.  One great thing in the series is seeing how the Baudelaires grew| changed| and matured.  In the first book| they could barely take care of themselves| by the end of 'The End'| they're trying to save the world (or what they can save of it).|||||
|||||||||||||
Handler did an incredible job inserting himself into the story and creating Jacques| Kit| VFD| etc.||||||||||
|||||||||||||
Now| for my theory about the sugar bowl; Snicket has it.  In PP| the mysterious man in the taxi is most likely Snicket (who else could it be?) and the text clearly states that he has an object from the sugar bowl.  It was a great plot device (Sunny| I believe| even calls it a 'Mcguffin' :) )and for an extremely unusual theory| I believe that the ring was inside the sugar bowl.  ('R'?  That could stand for Rhaldeen| as in Linda Rhaldeen| who's mentioned in 'UA' and is the Duchess of Winnipeg.  'Linda Rhaldeen' is an anagram for 'Daniel Handler' (!))  So| Lemony got the ring from 'Linda Rhaldeen' and gave it Beatrice who gave it back| etc.| etc.  Just a theory...|||

Crites,An incredible ending to an incredible series,31-Dec-08,""Clearly, this is not an ending that everyone """"agrees"""" with. It's not terribly surprising, in fact Lemony Snicket has often warned his readers that those looking for happy endings should look elsewhere. But the main reason people seem to be dissapointed is that he doesn't unveil the meaning behind many of the mysteries that he's created. But that's what I like most about it. Most of the answers can be found if you simply read all of his books a little more carefully. For example, he doesn't say exactly what's in the sugar bowl, but if you read the Unauthorized Autobiography, and some of the other books that mention the sugar bowl, you can get a pretty good idea of what it contains. In fact this book gives a pretty big hint that most people seem to miss..."|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||
The bottom line is| if you don't appreciate The End| then you really don't appreciate any of the books. The whole point of the Lemony Snicket books is that it teaches us that| unlike fairy tales| there are very few happy endings in life. In fact there are no endings. Just a series of moments- some bad| some good. There are many mysteries in the world| and it's the most important ones that there doesn't seem to be answers to. That's what The End is all about. And that's what makes it so beautiful. Thankfully the big question is answered- you do find out just who Beatrice is.|||||||
|||||||||||||
"In my opinion this is the greatest series of books ever written. Lemony Snickey (aka Daniel Handler) is one of the greatest writers alive today, and this book is proof of that. The End was never going to please everyone, no matter how he wrote it. It may not answer all of your questions, but it'll make you want to go back and read the series again to find the answers.
