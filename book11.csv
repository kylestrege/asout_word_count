J. Jones,A wonderful new edition to this Unfortunate Series!,23-Nov-04,""I still don't see why some reviewers are giving the Grim Grotto anything less than 5 stars!  The story as always was written in the beloved Lemony Snicket's grim humor.  I found the water cycle tied in to the story very creative and if you read it to the end, the readers will realize just how much the Baudelaire's lives really resemble the water cycle!  Surprisingly, Snicket teaches a very important and mature lesson, that not everything is always seen as black or white, but sometimes people are percieved as gray (or a tossed chef's salad!)  I found that lesson to be very important for the story and I congratulate Snicket for wanting to make the story mature along with the Baudelaires as well.  Snicket once again weaves an intricate story full of interesting characters, miracalous adventures, humor, and above all else, creativity.  The Grim Grotto is an excellent addition to the series giving us more questions surrounding V.F.D and leaving the reader eagerly wanting Book the Twelfth!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Grim-Grotto-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||

"The Grim Grotto is such a book. Each chapter is full of the most peculiar """"dire circumstances"""" and witty, tongue-in-cheek jabs at modern culture--the water cycle joke was perfect for me, whose 7th grade year was full of obsession about what came after condensation. It is almost like an adult book written to appeal to younger ages (if that makes any sense). There are mature ideas treated with tactful yet sly humor and the skill that makes it easy for a ten-year-old to understand."|||||||||||||||||

Aboard the submarine they are threatened from the outside by a giant mechanical monster and Count Olaf and his crew. Then we they finally do get out to walk around they are almost killed by poisonous mushrooms and despite all the precautions they take| disaster strikes anyway.||||||||||||||||

I think that this is one of the best books out of the Series of Unfortunate Events. The Grim Grotto is awesome from the start till the end; it contains old submarines, new characters, new villains, and a new underwater experiance."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
At the start of the book they had already lost a friend| his name was Quigley. Quigley was the triplets that meet them in the Slipery Slope. The Baudelaire meets the other two in the books The Austere Academy and The Vile Village. Violet is the inventor of the three children| once she invented a climbing devise in The Ersatz Elevator. Klaus is the reader of the children| for example| he found out were the V.F.D sugar bowl would be by using a map. Sunny is the cook| she cooked spaghetti in the grotto for the rest of the children when they were stuck there with the deadly mushrooms.||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The story The Slippery Slope has an ending that ties the ending of the book to the begging of the The Grim Grotto. The ending of The Slippery Slope| has the Baudelaire getting swept down rushing water| and Quigley gets separated form them. Then The Grim Grotto has the Baudelaire talking about what had happened. Out of know were a submarine comes with happens to contain two new characters that tie into the whole series. Fiona is a new character who loves funguses and mushrooms| she saves one of the characters lives in this book| and she also is the daughter of Captain Widdershins. He is the captain of the Quequeg| an old submarine that is falling apart. Later on they find out that they must be quiet because there is another ship with an eye on there radar fallowing them. After they explore the grim grotto they find them self trapped by poisonous marshrooms. Fiona knows a lot about the deadly fungus and they soon find a way out| but sadly one the Baudelaire's is infected. They get back to the Quequeg and encounter Count Olaf and his crew of children| Many old characters and a few unexpected changes happen at the new submarine| but all and all the children use there minds and an unexpected twist happens at the end. If my review isn't enough for you to go and read the now twelve series book then you just might want to do what lemony snicket says on the back of this book|||||||||

While there are more hints about the nature of V.F.D. and a bigger sense of how some of the disparate characters of the series are tying together, The Grim Grotto raises as many questions as it answers - actually, it asks WAY more than it answers. New characters (including a doozy of a new arrival to end the book), new threats that seem to intimidate friend and foe alike, more shifting alliances, and more moral shades of gray all combine to make just another knockout entry in this incredible series. Grim Grotto doesn't have some of the emotional heft that Slippery Slope had; what it does have, though, is a fantastic sense of humor, bringing some of the funniest scenes of the series, including a tap dance recital gone horribly wrong, a sea captain with bizarre running narration, Olaf's irritation at his newest """"colleague"""", and so much more. It's a blast of a book, all told with the usual great writing, clever wordplay, and surprisingly rich character work that's made the series so good to begin with. And more than that, it continues to be one of the few book sets for young audiences that explores morality in shades of gray and raises questions to which there are no easy answers - no small accomplishment in the often cut-and-dried YA adventure world."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Grim-Grotto-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||

To recap, the three Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, have sadly been through a series of some of the most unfortunate events ever to occur to a trio of intelligent children.  Violet, who is now 15 years old, is a master inventor who can use almost anything at her fingertips to build amazing machines that can be used for a variety of purposes, including helping herself and her siblings get out of some rather nasty predicaments.  The now-13-year-old Klaus is an extremely intelligent researcher, who loves to read and can remember everything he picks up in a book.  These skills constantly come in handy when the children are forced to figure out tough mysteries and problems in very short amounts of time.  And finally, Sunny, who has recently grown out of infanthood, has been endowed with extremely sharp teeth that allow her to bite her way out of many troubling situations.  Lately, she has been developing impressive culinary skills as well."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
After receiving some very troubling news about a terrible fire that killed their parents| the three children were sent to live with an obscure relative named Count Olaf.  Olaf was a terrible guardian who tried to steal the Baudelaire family fortune that the children had inherited.  After trying to marry (yes| marry!) Violet in order to get the money| the children moved in with their loving uncle.  Sadly| Olaf appeared in disguise and once again tried to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
This went on for a while until the children were sent to a strict boarding school where they met Duncan and Isadora Quagmire| two of three triplets who also lost their wealthy parents and their brother Quigley| the third triplet| in a terrible fire.  Like the Baudelaires| the Quagmires each had their own special skills.  Duncan was a journalist| Isadora was a poet| and Quigley| before the fire| was a cartographer.  The children became fast friends| until Olaf was able to capture the Quagmires.  Right before he took them away though| they were able to tell the Baudelaires about something they needed to find with the initials V.F.D.|||||||
|||||||||||||||||
Eventually| the three children were able to save their friends| but at the same time| Olaf was able to frame the siblings for murder| and the Baudelaires were forced to flee from the police to a hospital in the middle of nowhere.  Once there| they discovered many more secrets regarding V.F.D.| which they learned was a secret society.  After escaping the hospital| which had been set on fire by Olaf| the children were forced to go into disguise as carnival freaks in order to learn more about V.F.D. from Olaf and his crew.  There they learned about an important sugar bowl that Olaf needed to find| and later| they had to assist Olaf in burning down the carnival in order to maintain their disguises.  Sadly| Olaf discovered them| kidnapped Sunny| and sent Violet and Klaus careening down a snowy mountain in a runaway caravan.  The siblings survived and found out that Quigley was in fact still alive.  Violet| Klaus| and Quigley were able to rescue Sunny| find out the last safe place that V.F.D. would go| and escape Olaf yet again.  And this is where The Grim Grotto begins.
|||||||||||||||||
The Baudelaires| after being seperated from Quigley| the Baudelaires are found by a V.F.D. submarine captained by a man named Widdershins| and crewed by his step-daughter Fiona and Phil the Optimist from the Lucky Smells Lumbermill.  They embark on a mission to recover the sugar bowl before Olaf and the crew of the Carmelita (Olaf's sub named after the bratty Carmelita Spats) do.  Along the way| we learn some family history of one of Olaf's associates which turns out to come back to hurt the Baudelaires and Fiona.|||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"This is one of the best books yet in the series (although I'm still going with the fact that The Hostile Hospital is the best).  Throughout the last few books, the Baudelaires have been wondering about whether or not they themselves have been turning into villains themselves because they have been disguising themselves, they participated in arson, and they considered trapping Esme Squalor in order to participate in a prisoner exchange to get Sunny back.  In this book, the shades of gray get even grayer.  When Sunny is poisoned by some mushrooms that will kill her within the hour, they have to consider allowing her to die in order to preserve the greater good.  They also are forced to come to terms with the fact that even the people """"noble"""" side of the V.F.D. schism have bad qualities to them, even their parents."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"The stakes continue to get raised, as Olaf's troupe has now grown to a number big enough to crew an enormous submarine while V.F.D. struggles to remain a force for them to reckon with.  Amazingly, even though things are still dire at the end, Snicket is able to leave us with a small note of hope while we wait until the next book is released."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Grim-Grotto-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||

I was highly impressed with this novel's overall quality."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
 As every series author knows| the biggest challenge  is trying to make the next book more exciting and inventive then the last. Snicket clearly conquers this objective in The Grim Grotto. Never have I read a book that I would rather almost wet my pants then leave the middle of a chapter.||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
 In my opinion| the reason this book is so widely read and cherished by young adults of all ages is because almost everyone who reads them relates to the characters in some way. Not as far to being orphaned by a menacing fire or being hunted for your families fortune by a troupe of sadistic actors| but the emotions of depression| separation| and the bonding relationship of siblings is felt by all people of all ages. Violet| being the eldest Baudelaire| constantly finds herself in positions to make decisions and to generally conduct the behaviors of her other siblings. I too find myself in positions to take the lead and direct my siblings out of uncomfortable situations.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
 When found standing in a very dark dank grotto such as the Baudelaire children were| it is easy to give up or to admit that there is no light to be found at the end of their tunnel of broken dreams. Yet this conclusion was set apart to me from the other ten previous endings. While nearing the finish of this novel I felt as if there had been a small wisp of light at the end of their tunnel that could possibly reveal a more positive direction to lead the Baudelaires out of the dark. This novel was enticing and inventive. The reference of classical poetry was a nice addition for the novel's older readers.||||||||||||||||

As there are 13 books in the series, the end isn't too far off now."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The story begins with the Baudelaires drifting down the river after being separated by Quigley Quagmire| the third Quagmire sibling that had turned out to be alive in the last book. They somehow stumble across the Queequeg| a submarine under the command of Captain Widdershins whose motto is all about never hesitating to act. This makes him seem a bit reckless save for the rational presence of his stepdaughter Fiona that helps keep him in line. In contrast she's an aspiring mycologist| which means someone who studies mushrooms and other fungi. And they have been searching the area for a sugar bowl that for some reason is very important.||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
They work together to figure out where the sugar bowl might have drifted to after a Volunteer had supposedly saved it from the other group fromed from the V.F.D. schism. And this other group apparently involves Count Olaf| who continues to keep an eye out for them as he advances his other plans. But finding the sugar bowl is but one quest among many others as they try to avoid detection by Count Olaf and find out more about the once might V.F.D.||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
What I Liked: The last book really established a lot of new information about the secretive organization of V.F.D. And now it seems that almost everything has become related to the orgsanization and the bitter schism that had split the group in two. And that ads an interesting flavor to things as even the submarines and ocean facilities they use all represent this or that part of the organization's assets before.|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
I am also appreciating the steady progression of the Baudelaires to be more than just orphan kids on the run to perhaps becoming the newest recruits for V.F.D. even without formal training or being properly introduced into the group. It's a little thing but the implications in the long term make things more interesting and really have the children examining what is truly important to them and what their principles are shaping out to be.|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
And so many other twists in this book!|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
What Could Have Been Better: The character of Captain Widdershins is a very unnusual one and while his dedication to his motto is an initially amusing quirk| it all gets old pretty quickly. It's sort of a small blessing that he's only really active in the beginning of the book| but that doesn't quite explain why he really drops off the radar later on. It all felt like a weird narrative dead end.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The sugar bowl remains to be a rather unfuriating McGuffin that has practically come out of nowhere to be a majorly important element of this story. I wish we had more information about it and better understood why it was so important to find it but we don't get to question and we just go on trying. I think this could have been a little better managed| but that may just be me.||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||

Of course, in the usual Lemony Snicket fashion, the sad tales are told in such a funny way that the book becomes hilarious instead of being depressing like he claims it is supposed to be.  """"Grim Grotto"""" is the longest book in the series, but if readers can get past the dreary descriptions of the water cycle - meant to lull them into a catatonic state so they won't continue reading the depressing tale - they will be greatly rewarded."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"The story picks up with Violet, Sunny, and Klaus rushing down the Stricken Stream in a toboggan, just where we left them at the end of Book the Tenth.  But the orphans escape peril for the moment when they are saved by a submarine called the Queequeg. """"The submarine Q with its crew of two,"""" is manned by Captain Widdershins, a colorful character who ends all of his sentences with a resounding """"Aye,"""" and his stepdaughter, Fiona, a bright young teenager with an over-zealous interest in fungus."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
This new installment of the unfortunate events of the Baudelaire children includes a number of underwater adventures including a run-in with that ever-present villain| Captain Olaf| and his band of miscreants| a trip to an underwater cave| a budding romance| and the reemergence of characters that were long gone.  It's an exciting tale that will definitely attract the loyal followers of the series.  However| Snicket (who is really writer Daniel Handler) also includes flashbacks that will help those readers who have not been so faithful in keeping up with every volume.|||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"The """"Grim Grotto"""" is definitely gratifying to those who have been waiting to know what happens next in the Baudelaire's.  However, if they can get through all the warnings not to finish the book, they will be no closer to discovering the mystery of V.F.D or the sugar bowl then they were before.

"A Series of Unfortunate Events is the best American book series going right now, bar none (the implication being that I am familiar with quite a few, but not all, of the most important current American book series).  These are not childern's books, they are simply books, like White Fang and Tom Sawyer, that can be enjoyed by thinking people of all ages (trust me, even pre-literate infants find these books """"tasty"""").  Mr. Handler, the anonymous author, has a style that is unique and delightful.  He doesn't assume, as many authors do (see Dan Brown), that the reader is totally stupid.  He expects more."|||||||||||||||||

|||||||||||||||||
Oh| how wrong I was. The Grim Grotto reveals many more secrets about V.F.D.| and we learn a lot about Aunt Josephine and her husband Ike- more than we ever knew.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
I can't say too much about this. But it does remind me a lot like The Slippery Slope. The Slippery Slope had the Snicket file| The Grim Grotto had the sugar bowl. The Slippery Slope Had Quigley| The Grium Grotto had Fiona. The Slippery Slope had ice| The Grim Grotto had water. And other things.||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
However| as similar (sort of) as the two books are| I have to say that The Grim Grotto is MUCH more exciting than The Slippery Slope| which I found rather dull at times (all it is is climbing up and down a mountain).||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
And the ending- the ending is definitely the best of all the books. No| it's not as cliff-hanging as The Carnivorous Carnival. No| it wasn't as sad as The Austere Academy. And no| it wasn't as dangerous as The Hostile Hospital. It is| however| the best ending of all the books| and all I can say is that it connects books 1-10 and shoots forward in a whole new direction. Plus a character from the past is introduced again. *cough cough*|||||||||||

If you were disappointed by The Slippery Slope like I was| then don't be afraid- The Grim Grotto is much more exciting| and much more full of ever day lessons. I'll end my review with this quote of the hook-handed man.|||||||||||||||

He is always saying commands and saying Aye after everything.  He is also always stating his personal philosophy wich is he or she who hesitates is lost.  Count Olaf also has a new annoying laugh.  An example of one of his annoying laughs is hup hup ha ha hammy hee hee and sniggle ha ho ho.  After about the 50th time it starts to get old."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
Enough about the negatives though.  The manner of speach was just about the only bad thing about the book.  The storyline was great.  This book is also my new favorite in the series.  The rest of my review I will explain some of the book.  If you have not yet read the book and want to know absolutely nothing about the book then please do not read the rest of my review.  I will not give away the ending though as it is very good.|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The story starts off exactly where the last book began.  That is another good thing about the series| they flow nicely.  The Baudelairs are in a broken toboggan rafting down the Stricken Stream.  They spot a submarine.  They are not sure if inside the submarine there is a friend or a foe.  They decide to risk it.  They open the latch.  Inside is Captain Widdershins| and his crew.  He starts off with his annoying Aye's and pointless commands.  He however is not an enemy.  It turns out that he knows all about the Baudelaires and their life.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
Along board his submarine| named the  Queequeg| is some new friends and some old ones.  There is the captain's granddaughter Fiona.  Who is very interested in molds and fungus.  Phil is also on board.  Phil is there old friend from Lucky Smells Lumbermill.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The mission of the submarine is to find the sugar bowl before Count Olaf does.  Klaus| after studying many tidal charts| thinks that the sugar bowl may be in the Georgian Grotto.  The Baudelaires and Fiona go in the cave to find it.  They are unsuccessfully however.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
When they return to the ship they find that everyone is missing.  They are no where to be seen.  They also notice that Sunny has a deadly fungus growing on her.  If she does not recieve the antidote she could die with-in an hour.  The only problem is that they do not know what the antidote is.  And to make matters worse Count Olaf's submarine shows up| and Count Olaf takes the kids away.||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The rest of the book I will not give away| although it is very good.  The very end involves an old friend from way back.||||||||||||||||

From the trouble they encounter to the people they meet the story is very different from the rest. There are only two new characters, Fiona and Captain Widdershinns who are both members of VFD, however they haven't quite decided which side of the schism they're on. There is a returning character too which is funny and exciting."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The cons:|||||||||||||||||
Captain Widdershinns is to say in the least| very annoying. He must repeat the word aye after every single sentence and the author uses this technique to waste pages at a time. Most of all his speech doesn't match the seriousness of the rest of the book. Widdershinns could have been a serious character and made the book even darker| rather than just making the book annoying.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"They are starting to turn Olaf into a comical character rather than a sinister villan. His """"new laugh"""" is also annoying and he is starting to not seem the least bit scary and I'm wondering why the children fear him. I know he's not supposed to be to realistic because it could frighten children but he was much better how snicket portrayed him in the earlier books (himself, Stophono, Sham, Shirley, Gengis, Gunthur, Dupin)"|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The pros:|||||||||||||||||
The whole part when they went into the grotto and returned to the empty submarine was written so well. It was so dark and thrilling that it was almost creepy. I can't give away much so I'll just say it's the best part!|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
When they save sunny is one of the happiest things ever to happen to the Baudelaire's| and it's so happy it makes you want to cry tears of joy along with them.||||||||||||||||

The best part of the whole book is the last 4 pages. It's by far the best ending of all the books and is just soo good. There's a return of a character whom they haven't seen for a long time| and has a great cliffhanger. I can't ruin it for you so I'll just say it was really really good again.||||||||||||||||

They meet a captain and a couple of other important people who try to take them to safety in a submarine. I loved the Grim Grotto because it is funny and exciting. It is really cool that some part of the story takes place in a submarine. It also is a little bit sad because they have lost their parents and now all they have is a tiny raft floating downstream.

In this latest book, the three children Violet, Klaus and Sunny find themselves in even more trouble. There is a submarine, some very poisnous fungi that has affected one of the children, an evil villian and his crew, some new people that turn out to betray the children,some answers to questions that the children have wanted to know for a while, and a very important person shows up at the end of the story that may help the children a great deal.

The Queequeg submarine is not exactly in good shape, so the Baudelaires are not exactly any more safe in this particular chapter of their lives than they ever were.  During their perilous quest to find the mysterious sugar bowl down in an underwater grotto found on the bottom of the Striken Stream, the unlucky children encounter a poisonous fungus known as the Medusoid Mycelium.  The deadly mushroom has the ability to grow on human throats and choke its victim to death in an hour or less.  Of course, one of the Baudelaires is infected by the horrible fungus and might not make it to the next book!  This book, along with all of the other books in the series, is great read for the little kids and the teens and the adults and everyone else who loves a good page-turner.  Not only is this book a good mystery, but also touches on the subject of villainy.  Just like in real life, characters in the book change from being good to evil and vise-versa - a serious topic to discuss to readers.  Besides that, Lemony Snicket (the author) makes references to various famous writers and their words through the Verse Fluctuation Declaration poem-involving V.F.D. code (similar to Aunt Josephine's and the Quagmires') and the submarine's name and uniform.  Even though it is fiction, I would not doubt that A Series of Unfortunate Events will someday become a book required in many schools.  They are simply so well-written with suspense, humor, mystery, and a bit of drama! (By the way, my review`s title speaks the truth)."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Grim-Grotto-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||

Count Olaf and his evil minions are still after the Baudelaire children| but Olaf has definitely changed.  He doesn't seem nearly as evil as he was in past and he now has the most awful laugh which just about drove me crazy (perhaps this was intended???).  There are also changes in the Baudelaires - the children are growing up.  Sunny is no longer a baby and has become a very interesting character.  The older sibs have more issues to face| including conflicts with each other.  We receive more clues about VFD and characters from previous books show up - and not everyone is quite as they have appeared in past.|||||||||||||||

At the beginning of THE GRIM GROTTO, the eleventh installment in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, the three children are rescued in the nick of time by a passing submarine. Just when they think they are safe, though, the Baudelaires are in for their most harrowing adventures yet."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
The Queequeg submarine is captained by Widdershins| a jovial but impatient fellow who is searching underwater for the mysterious sugar bowl that holds important secrets. It seems that the sugar bowl has vanished into a treacherous underwater cave| so small that only the children (including Widdershins's daughter Fiona) can enter it. Little do they know| though| that the cave is filled with poisonous mushroom spores| one of which is inhaled by one of the Baudelaires. Soon| the kids are in a race against time as they try to save their sibling and escape from Count Olaf| who is lurking nearby in a submarine of his own.||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"Unlike the earlier books in this series, Count Olaf is not really a central character here. Instead, this book introduces some new characters and helps shed light on old nemeses such as the hook-handed man. Lemony Snicket continues to be darkly humorous, with jokes that sometimes seem aimed as much at adults as at children; when the three Baudelaires try to decipher T. S. Eliot's THE WASTE LAND, Violet says, """"Maybe it's all in code."""""|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
In the end| THE GRIM GROTTO introduces more mysteries than it solves. Since this is Book the Eleventh of a thirteen-book series| though| the end of the Baudelaires' adventures is rapidly approaching and the Hotel Denouement is in sight. It remains to be seen| though| whether these three unlucky orphans have any hope for a happy ending.||||||||||||

Soon they are picked up by the submarine Queequeg, piloted by Captain Widdershins, with his stepdaughter Fiona, and Phil, an old friend from an earlier book, on board. The children are in search of a sugar bowl, which has vanished into a treacherous underwater cave, so small that only the children can enter it. Unfortunately, the cave is filled with poisonous mushrooms and soon the life of one of the Baudelaires is in danger. Just as they are rushing to find an antidote Count Olaf comes aboard the submarine and tries to throw the children in the brig. Will they escape from Count Olaf? Will they get an antidote in time? Where is the sugar bowl? And where did Captain Widdershins and Phil disappear to?"|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"Lemony Snickets answers some, but not all of those questions in this delightful entry in the series. As usual the book is filled with quirky characters, including Captain Widdershins and his constant use of the word """"Aye"""" and his motto """"He who hesitates is lost"""", Phil, who sees the bright side of everything, and Fiona, who knows an awful lot about mushrooms. Viola, Klaus and Sunny are all growing up, with Viola and Klaus showing interest in the opposite sex and learning that maybe their parents weren't perfect after all. Sunny is speaking more and more clearly and while it's still fun to try and decipher what she is saying, it's a lot easier than it was in the earlier books."|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||
"These books are not just for children, as an adult, I really enjoy this series. I really liked this book, but it left a lot of questions that need to be answered in the two books remaining in the series. This book does end on a happier note than any of the previous books, which I found intriguing. I can't wait for the next one!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,,"|||||||||||||||||
