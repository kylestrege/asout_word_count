When their parents perished in a fire, they thought life couldn't get any worse. They were wrong. When the three children are sent to live with a distant relative, they had hoped their luck was about to change for the better. Unfortunately, they had reckoned without Count Olaf and his diabolically fiendish scheme to steal the children's inheritance.
The Series of Unfortunate Events are books that are very different to the typical image of children's literature. As the narrator says, ""There is no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and there are very few happy things in the middle."" The author uses a dark, dry sense of humour and depending on how you focus upon the book, it can either be depressing or very funny. I personally found it very good, but from reading it I can understand why some parents say it gives their kids nightmares. Some of the things that happen to the three orphans are just plain awful.
The characters are both entertaining and interesting - Count Olaf is repulsively evil - and the Baudelaires are intelligent, resourceful children who enjoying inventing and reading. No matter what happens, they will always find some solution to their problems, even though more bad things are just around the corner.
I recommend this to all kids over the age of 9. Some people call it a JK Rowling wannabe but I disagree. This series is nothing like Harry Potter, nor it as good, but then what children's book could be? I'll definitely be buying more in this wonderfully miserable series."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

After 5 months, maybe more, I started to read it out of boredom. I found it extremely exciting! Sure it isn't action packed, but it is so well written that you can't wait to see what Snicket will write next. This really isn't a book for most people. It's dreary and sad, but for those who enjoy a witty author, a good plot, and can see past the drearyness to then understand a bit of the humor that comes into this book, than it should be a most enjoyable read.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews

Written in the best English childhood storytelling style, this is all quite witty and wicked at the same time.

Disturbingly wicked at times.  Threatened infanticide, child abuse, and attempted statutory rape are not exactly topics you want to expose younger children or the over-impressionable to.  But face it.  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny would hever reach their potential without good 'ol Count Olaf to spur them along.  He's the villain that too many stories need (including the aforementioned HP) but never get.

Although, I have to say that adults will find this yarn compelling enough to laugh at too.

The orphans in this story are tragically unlucky, but strive to turn their lives around with almost unbelievable optimism. Each child has their own unique talent, not superhuman in nature, but ordinary enough to relate to children.

The gothic storyline is immense, funny, tragic and unique. Lemony Snicket is a genius in storytelling of this kind, hooking you in with his: Don't read any further if ..., lines. You can't help but not read on. The storyline may be dark, incredibly dark, and somewhat more mature than most children's fiction, but nonetheless it is apt for the series as a whole. Children don't always have to read fairytales and happily ever after stories. Count Olaf is a despicable antagonist, which only drives your admiration for the orphans even stronger.

The book hints at further, unearthed mysteries that will become apparent along the series, which is a brilliant device for children to follow. I certainly want to relive this series as a whole."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Bad Beginning:
Lemony Snicket:
ISBN 0-06-440766-7

 Why do bad things always happen to kids?  Violet and her brother and sister, Klaus and Sunny started off by having their parents die on the second page of this book.  They wound up in an orphanage but then they later found out there was a distant relative willing to take them.  When the orphans got to this mans house, it turned out he was a mean, cruel, guy named Count Olaf that only cared about money.  The orphans later found out they were doomed and they would probably rather die then spend another day with this crook.  This is a realistic fiction book and is great for all ages.

 This book was awesome.  I was always looking forward to turning the next page everytime.  It was funny and it had me jumping off my seat at every chapter.  Kids from the ages 9-20 would probably enjoy this book best because of the dialog.  If you like building or inventing things, you would also enjoy this book.  Inventor, Violet Baudelarie, was the main character in the book and she could invent anything on the top of her mind. Whenever she would invent something, she would twirl her hair into a ponytail and that meant she was in thinking mode.  If you enjoy reading you would probably like Claus.  He has read almost every book in America.  He is a smart boy just looking for a way around Count Olaf.  Now if you are a baby reading this book, you would enjoy reading about Sunny and her wacky way of talking. She would make up words that probably mean something in real english.  She is just a toddler that looks up to her brother and sister.  She has amazingly sharp teeth so watch out.  While I was reading this book, I was so surprised about how Count Olaf wanted to merry Violet.  If you read this book you will know why he wanted to.  I personally enjoyed this genre because there wasn't any flying pigs or floating people.  It is just as real as the real world.  This book was remarkable because of the way the author wrote the book.  He wrote in a fluid style of not going to overboard in each chapter.  He didn't just write two words and then jumped right into a conclusion.  He wrote why it happened and how it happened.  He is just a great author.  This book was the direct adverse of boring.  It always had something coming up and it had some great humor a long the way.  My mind did sometimes wander while I was reading this book.  I always thought of if my parents just died instantly like that.  I know I wouldn't be as brave as they were.  I don't think they even cried once.  This book was great I would read it again.  There are other sequels to this book like The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window, so you should check those ones out too.  This book is the best  book that I have ever read."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews

Lemony Snicket
Reviewed by: A Pandey
Period : 5th
  The Baudelaire's are great and a wealthy family, but not for long.  Terrible news comes to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny when they were at the beach.  Mr. Poe their family's banker came and told the children's that their parents had died in a terrible fire.  Now the 3 kids Violet, who was interested in inventing stuff, Klaus who loved to read books, and Sunny who loved to bite things all became an orphan.  Violet being the oldest child swear oath that she will protect her siblings no matter what.  Mr. Poe took these orphans and gave them to Count Olaf, not knowing that he is an evil uncle.  The only thing Count Olaf did was tried to snatch the fortune of the Baudelaire.  The Baudelaire's parents had left an enormous amount of money for their kids but they could only get it when they turn 18.  Count Olaf tried to snatch the fortune by marring Violet because she is the oldest. He failed to get the Fortune and right before the police caught him he told the kids he would come back for the fortune!  Unfortunately, Count Olaf managed to escape when the police came.
  I loved this book because this book does not have a happy ending like the other common books.  The author in this book actually tells the readers not to buy his work because its very sad, and not a happy ending.  You can never put this book down because in every chapter there is something new and exciting.  For instant at the end of the book no one knew that Violet would sign the marriage paper with her left hand. A thing like that really excites me. From the time of their parent's death till the escape of Count Olaf the book was never boring!  One of the favorite quotes I like in this book was when Count Olaf said,
""I will come back to steal your fortune"".  That quote is now going to make me read the next book.
  There actually wasn't anything that I didn't like about this book.  I thought it would be boring by the cover; instead it came out to be a great book. I really liked the characters of this book because all the three Baudelaire's are different. Violet is trying to save her sister with the help of Klaus. Sunny has become a hostage until the marriage of Voilet and Count Olaf.  The other quote from this book is by Mr. Poe, "" Your parents died in a terrible fire"".  This quote had got me out of my bed and ready to read the great book.
  My favorite part of the book was when; Count Olaf was going to marry Violet.  He had told her that if she doesn't agree with the marriage he would tell his members to kill her little sister, Sunny.  Violet was really scared and didn't want her sister to die, so she agreed by signing the paper.  Count Olaf was really happy and he was about to leave when Violet told everyone about him and what he wants to do by marrying her.  Violet also told i should not be married to him because I signed the paper with my left hand when, I always sign with my right hand.  The judge agreed and called the police to capture Count Olaf but he was too quick and he ran away.  This was my favorite part of the book because it was the most exciting part, you didn't know what would come next."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

If you are a parent trying to get their kid to read this is the perfect book, since it has a movie, after the kids watch they will be willing to read the books even more.

I do have to admit some of the situations may be a little harsh for younger children and seeing as there are 13 books they might find it too long.

The Baudelaires Siblings. Violet, Klaus and Sunny live a happy live with their two parents in the Baudelaire Mansion, but one gloomy day their banker Mr.Poe informs them there has been a terrible fire that has taken their parents life. The Baudelaires now orphans move with their closest relative (in location not family bloodline) Count Olaf a wicked man with greedy intentions, getting the Baudelaire fortune.

Lemony Snickets mysterious ways and beautiful writing show in this book, as we take a plunge in the Baudelaires unfortunate live and the turmoil they go through living with Count Olaf."|5.0 out of 5 stars||

It's true, the story of the Baudelaire children is depressing, but once you get passed that, Snicket has a Douglas Adams-like wit which results in a lot of dark humor. There's also a good supply of plot twists to keep anyone over 12 occupied. The kids emerge alright in this one and survive to move onto another story. What will happen in the next book? I don't know, but no doubt it will be filled with doom and gloom and impossible situations that the Baudelair orphans will escape by their wits for a short time before their next terrfying ordeal begins.
Lemony Snicket is actually Daniel Handler, by the way. I saw him play his accordion with the Magnetic Fields in concert once, and you'd never expect something this good from some guy in the background.

You'd think he likes reading but no, he just likes Lemony Snicket! Getting my son to read was like pulling eyebrows with a pair of tongs but now I'm forcing him to put the book down and go to bed. Last year he had very little AR points. This year he already has the most in his grade.

These series of books are humorous yet intriguing. I love the way the narrator speaks to the reader, defining words and explaining the reasons that things are happening without making the reader seem ignorant. His language is both witty and wacky - go figure. And the suspense rises with every page keeping a mind, like my 9-y-old's, captivated and, unfortunately, awake.

So, if you're a parent like me with a child like mine, this series is a winner. I just have to figure out what to do when my son finishes the series. And, at this rate, that could be anytime soon."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

It is really good you should read it.
A series of unfortunate events the bad beginning by Lemony Snicket, three young children the Bouldalairs had something terrible happen to them and their lives were horrible living with a cruel man named count Olaf.
People should read this book because when I read it was amazing it had comedy, humor, excitement, horror, it was a really fun book to read.
There are three kids. Violet the oldest she was an inventor she could think of inventions. Claus the middle child loved to read books. And sunny the youngest child could eat things hard like a rock. Their house burnt down and their parents died in the terrible fire. A man in charge of their huge fortune Mr. Poe lets count Olaf be their new guardian in control of them. Some strengths that I liked the part when they came to count Olaf’s house he was saying “hello, hello, hello” and the door was shut. Some weakness were when the part was that he didn’t provide them with one bed and he was not very nice to the children. He also didn’t have a nice and tidy house.
Count Olaf has a weird ugly looking house and he only gave them one bed to sleep, he has a theater troop coming over and he told them to cook them a dinner for his theater troop his theater troop are weird looking but you will have to read the book to see what they look like. Some strengths were I liked when count Olaf sang a song when the children were walking in with their hands full of food. Some weaknesses were I don’t like that count Olaf is making then cook dinner when they have no experience of cooking food for his theater troop.
So count Olaf has an evil plan to marry Violet and get their fortune, they figure out his plan and something happens you will just have to find out what happens, also something happens to sunny but like I said read to find out. Some strengths were I liked the part when one of the theater troop people say to Violet “once count Olaf gets your fortune he will just have to kill you and your little siblings”. Some weaknesses were I didn’t like that count Olaf is so greedy and wants their fortune just for himself.
The theme/ lesson was to never give up and keep trying your hardest if something goes wrong just keep trying, also to not be greedy and be happy for what you have.
Some complaints and questions were, what I didn’t like was about count Olaf and how he’s mean and wants his way to get their fortune.
I challenge you to go get this book at your public library, I know you will love it."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

As it turns out, their instincts are correct -- the Count is determined to get his creepy, long-nailed hands on the substantial Baudelaire fortune, no matter the cost.  The first of a thirteen-book series, The Bad Beginning kicks things off with a unique, classically charming, and delightfully grisly story.

What stands out the most in this quick, page-turning read is Snicket's inimitable voice.  The narration is clever, engaging, and never-before-seen in a completely indescribable way.  Snicket strays from traditional story-telling and acts as the bearer of bad tidings, frequently warning us of horrible events to come and humorously pausing to define potentially confusing phrases for our benefit.

The story is tightly-knit and clean, and thus is enjoyable for all ages.  The character of Count Olaf is wrapped in cliche, but he takes on his own style and leaves other greedy schemers in the dust.  The children are commendable heroes, all likeable and with distinctive traits particular to each.

All in all, this beginning is anything but bad.  Writing like that of Lemony Snicket is a rarity, and not one that should be passed up.  I heartily recommend this book (and its successors) to anyone and everyone old enough to read."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

I usually ignore crazes and fads in literature (yes, I'm afraid this also includes Harry Potter).  I just don't like getting sucked into something that everyone else and their dog are into.  But seeing THE BAD BEGINNING and its sequels on the shelves for so long started sparking my interest and curiosity primarily because when I first bought it, there was virtually no hype around it at all.  I never heard anyone talking about Lemony Snicket or any rave reviews or anything.  But now, with a new film soon to be released from Dreamworks (and starring Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf), more and more people are starting hear the name Lemony Snicket.
For someone who has just written ten New York Times bestsellers, one would not have thought that Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) would have started this literary endeavor with the attitude that he could never write a children's book ""because children's books are such crap.""  But THE BAD BEGINNING is clearly a break from the norm in children's fiction, especially children's serial fiction.
The author does a wonderful job of throwing his wit into the mix of chaos and turmoil in the plot.  For instance, every now and again, he'll use a word which many children may not understand, but he'll explain it its context, saying, ""...a word which here means...""  For example, on page 121: ""But thanks to her adroit inventing skills - the word 'adroit' here means 'skillful' - everything worked the way it was supposed to work...""  And for humor, Sunny, the youngest of the three orphan siblings (and a mere infant), will often say things like ""Hux,"" ""Gibbo,"" ""Jook,"" and ""Book!...she probably meant something like 'Would somebody please wipe my face?'"" (80)
At one point in the story, the author even goes so far as to play with the reader's mind a little bit.  If you've ever found yourself falling asleep while reading (perhaps you're even nodding off while reading my review - if so, shame on you!), then you'll recall that you may unconsciously read the same sentence over and over, because you can't remember if you had read that part before dozing off.  On page 94, Klaus (the young boy orphan) is staying up late one night reading:
""The book was long, and difficult to read, and Klaus became more and more tired as the night wore on.  Occasionally his eyes would close.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.""
Much of the wit and plays on words and grammar will make this book equally appealing to adults - a word which here means a physically and mentally mature person who is young at heart in terms of his or her literary choices - as much as the exciting story will appeal to kids."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

Count Olaf treats the children like scum and makes them do all of his chores and some that he doesn't need done. Count Olaf is abusive to the children and even makes them cook dinner.

Katz|A Wonderful Beginning of a Great Series!|21-Jan-04|"For a couple of years I have been hearing about a series of Young Adult books written by Lemony Snicket.  It wasn't until I taught a 7th grade Language Arts class this year that I was introduced to the first book when one of my students encouraged me to begin reading this series by lending me the first book, The Bad Beginning.  I felt compelled to read it immediately and was happy to tell both this student and others, including teachers how much I loved the first book and couldn't wait to continue reading the series. And having just finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I did marvel at how children's and young adult books have changed over the years.  Gone are some of the very sweet stories I was used to and found them replaced with child wizards filled with angst and a group of siblings coping with being orphans as well as villains and terrible events in their young lives.
The blurb on the back of The Bad Beginning warns readers that the book they are holding is extremely unpleasant.  Readers are also warned that the book will reveal an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children, known as the Baudelaires.  And a sorry tale this book does tell although the reader is rooting that these children will overcome whatever befalls them.  It is a credit to the author that despite the unhappy events described there is a sense of fun and some very quick thinking on the parts of the children.
I did find this a fast and most enjoyable read. Particularly clever was the author's explanation of words and emotions that most children would not know.  Some of the explanations found me even laughing despite the serious nature of the Baudelaire children's dilemmas. I also marveled at how Lemony Snicket so easily puts you right into these children's world. And I particularly loved the character of each child and their own inventiveness for getting them out of trouble. And the villainous Count Olaf who quickly becomes the children's nemesis is just devilish enough to entice you to continue reading.
I recently finished the last book so far in the series, The Slippery Slope, and am now eagerly waiting for the next book to be published.  And as if that wasn't enough I have just learned that a movie from this series with Jude Law as Lemony Snicket and Jim Carrey as Count Olaf will be coming to the silver screen shortly.  Like other treasured series that children and adults alike can look forward to and remember, I predict the series of unfortunate events will have a long and happy future."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket( a series of unfortunate events ) is a very well written book. Instead of a little kid book where you always expect the ending to be happy (books aren't fun if you already know the ending). The story is about three intelligent siblings who's parents died in a fire that burned down their whole mansion. The parents left them with Count Olaf (a very intelligent villian) who is planning to steal the enormous fortune their parents left them with. Count Olaf's plan was almost a sucess, but the Baudelaires found out about it and fooled him. I definitely recomend this book.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews

Roby|LUCKY FIND|7-Aug-04|"I learned about ""The Series of Unfortunate Events"" series from watching a ""CBS Morning"" segment of the author introducing the books to a captivated audience of children at a bookstore event.  I was intrigued.  I bought the first three books.  Then the next three, and the next three, and...I'm impressed.

The books target age 9 but are enjoyed by all ages, even adults.  The books have so much personality and read aloud well, in case you read a chapter to your children every evening like I do.  The humor is clever and subtle (grown-ups will appreciate it).  The story is exciting, showcasing the Baudelaire children as resourceful, intelligent role models for young readers.

However, as an English teacher, I was especially impressed with the author's ingenious way of lacing the story with definitions of words, which never seems contrived nor impedes the story telling.  Book Two begins by defining the word ""irony""...no kidding!  Can you imagine that in a children's book?

If you're not yet convinced, consider this...I taught a grade 10 special education last year and selected this book for a class novel.  The 30 reluctant readers came to class the next day and said they had read the book overnight!  They couldn't believe they had actually read an entire book and loved it so much and couldn't put it down.  They begged to read Book Two.  The school librarian ordered the entire set, and they've been checked out non-stop ever since the books arrived.  Now that's a recommendation!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

L. Rishe|Particularly good for intermediate second-language learners|5-Jan-06|"Ok, I know this review won't apply to very many people, but...

I've read books 2-4 of this series in Spanish, and so far 1/3 of book 7 in Japanese.  I read books 1, 5 and 6 in English purely for enjoyment.  I've found that these books have helped me immensely in expanding my Spanish and Japanese skills.  The vocabulary is on a fairly elementary level, much easier than Harry Potter, but the writing is so good that it doesn't feel like a simplistic children's book, and the books are so engaging that it's not so much of a chore to look up hundreds of words in the dictionary.  The translations I've encountered do a great job of imitating Snicket's writing style in their own language.

In my opinion, there's no better way to get an ingrained feeling for the form, structure and essential vocabulary of a language than by reading a novel or two in that language, and these books are aptly suited for that task.  I just bought the first box set for some Japanese friends of mine who are learning English.

It all starts with Book 1.  Enjoy."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

It was an awesome story. It all started at Count Olaf’s house. Count Olaf, a villain, is an uncle in the story and becomes the guardian of the Baudelaire children. The children include Violet the oldest, Klaus the middle child, and Sunny the youngest. They are orphans until they find themselves in the care of the Count. This should be a happy solution but it is not.
  The Count is an extremely awful person who tortures the children. He is trying to swindle their fortune from them. This book is one of many in The Series of Unfortunate Events but in each the Count tries a scheme to get the fortune. In the first book, The Bad Beginning, Count Olaf tries to marry Violet. To accomplish this the Count has to lock Sunny up as a hostage to convince Violet to marry him. In the end Violet tricked the Count by signing the marriage document with her left hand making it invalid.  With his plan being discovered the Count makes his escape and vows to get the fortune no matter what. The Baudelaires are safe at least for the time being.
  The best thing about this book is the characters. Sonny was especially my favorite because she bites people all the time. I also enjoyed it because it was not only full of excitement but had some mystery in it too. For example in the house the author did a great job especially when he described the pictures of eyes being everywhere to match the one on Count Olaf’s ankle. Lastly I thought that the best part was when they discover the eye on Count Olaf’s ankle. I could not put the book down and immediately started on the second.

Smith|Not you Winnie-the-Pooh!|25-Apr-02|"Quoting from the opening of Chapter 7: ""There are many, many types of books in the world, which makes good sense, because there are many, many types of people, and everybody wants to read something different. For instance, people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children should put this book down immediately."" And they certainly do. The Baudelaire children -- fourteen-year-old Violet, twelve-year-old Klaus, and their infant sister, Sunny -- are off at the beach one day when Mr. Poe the banker comes to tell them that their loving parents have perished tragically in a fire and that their mansion has been utterly destroyed. They will have to go and live with Count Olaf, their (geographically) nearest relative, until Violet is old enough to inherit. He's a horrid, dirty, smelly, scheming, dangerous man, and an actor to boot. Their life there is terrible, even with the kind Justice Strauss and her lovely library next door. And then Count Olaf begins making plans to get his hands on their fortune. The author (whose real name is Daniel Handler) is obviously perverse and possibly deranged, and I love his work; it's hard to tell, sometimes, whether he's really writing for kids or for weird adults. This is the first of a projected thirteen volumes, and all of them are going on my Edward Gorey shelf."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews

At the beginning of the book when the author says don't keep reading if you hate bad endings he is quite right. First the Baudelaire children get the most horrifying news from Mr. Poe, a guy who can't seem to stop coughing, that their parents had died in a horrible fire. They have a fortune but they learn the unfortunate news that they can't have it until the oldest Violet who is 14 becomes adult age. So their lawyer Mr. Poe takes the three children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to the horrible guardian Count Olaf who will stop at nothing to get their fortune. The three orphans seem defensless against Count Olaf's evil plans as he traps Baby Sunny in the forbidden tower until Violet would marry him. However Count Olaf seems to have underestimated these smart children!
This book was really really funny. In many ways it has the humor and darkness of Harry Potter and even more.

I picked up the first book on a whim and devoured the entire series in a month. It had been a long time since I really enjoyed a book series like this. Author Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snickett) brings the much needed absurd in this mock-goth book series. The world of these books is rich, fun and extremely dreadful (but entertaining).

The tone and form of the book are unique, so don't try to compare it to other series. This is a set all on it's own. It's always fun to read and see how the Baudelaires will cope with their situation.

I also love that, unlike most kids' stories where the children lose their parents, the Baudelaires actually have to deal with their grief. They never seem to ""just get over it"" or have a short cry and it's done. As Lemony Snicket said, """"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed. If you have ever lost someone very important to you, then you already know how it feels, and if you haven't, you cannot possibly imagine it."""|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

1.It makes you want to keep reading
2.Its humorous
3.Its entertaining and interesting to read
4.The author has a great sense of humor
5.The author uses descriptive words
  Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire are three very unlucky children. When their parents perished in a fire, they thought life couldn't get any worse. They were wrong. When the three children are sent to live with a distant relative, they had hoped their luck was about to change for the better. Unfortunately, they had reckoned without Count Olaf and his diabolically fiendish scheme to steal the children's inheritance.
  The Series of Unfortunate Events are books that are very different to the typical image of children's literature. As the narrator says, ""There is no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and there are very few happy things in the middle."" The author uses a great sense of humor and depending on how you focus upon the book, it can either be depressing or very funny. I personally found it very good and interesting to read. Even though some of the things that happen to the three orphans are just plain awful, it still makes me want to read more and more.
The characters are both entertaining. Count Olaf is dangerously evil. The Baudelaires are intelligent, clever, resourceful children who enjoying reading and inventing. No matter what happens, they will always find some solution to their problems, even though more bad things are just around the corner.
  This book is really fun to read and very interesting. I recommend this book to all kids of all ages. Whoever reads this book will enjoy it and when they start reading it, I bet they wouldn't want to put it down."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews

My daughter, who has ADD, had great difficulty finding chapter books that captured and held her attention. As much as she enjoyed the Harry Potter movies, she could not focus long enough to read the books.

When we started ""The Bad Beginning,"" she couldn't stop reading! The Baudelaire orphans each had a quality that interested her. Violet loves to invent and is fascinated by how things work. Klaus is a natural sleuth: an avid researcher and detective in his own right. And Baby Sunny is so infectiously wonderful. She bites, but only the bad guys!

I recommend these books to children and adults alike.

Well, if so, you may be better off reading another book, as the author put on the first page. Why, probably because this book has neither a happy beginning nor ending. Misfortune starts to lurk the three Baudelaire children from chapter one when they're told by Mr. Poe, while at Briny Beach, the news of their parent's death. Sadly, for the children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, their mansion also perished. The Baudelaire children, with no other place to go, lived with Mr. Poe and his family. However, they moved again when Mr. Poe, following Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire's wills, found them another place to live at their relative, Count Olaf's, house. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny begin to cheer up considering that they have a new place to live without Mr. Poe's irritable sons, Edgar and Albert. Plus, their neighbor, Justice Strauss, has an amazing library and is very pleasant. Though, despair and tragedy still lurk at their heels as they start to suspect Count Olaf when they uncover his plot to steal their fortune. Will Violet, Klaus, and Sunny be able to stop him? Before you decide, remember that the book is truly unpleasant and defiantly does not have a happy ending.
My favorite parts of The Bad Beginning are when the Baudelaire siblings encounter Count Olaf's theater troupe. I like these certain parts because the troupe is so evil and vile, including Olaf. The actors are so rigid and are masterminds when it comes to being deceitful. The hook-handed man is my favorite. When the author described his character and even his tone of voice when he and Violet met on top of the tower it sent shivers down my spine. I knew that I would never want cross his path and get him upset. I wouldn't know what to do if I was one of the Baudelaire siblings and I raised his temper.
Again, like others, I liked this book because it didn't end with ""happily ever after"" or with a puppet turning into a real boy. This book was a change for me, since the disaster that haunted the orphans didn't seem to vanish. Though, I don't think it totally surpassed Harry Potter because I like to read about magic and the fairy tale, princess life. However, both books seem to not acquire a happy ending and have intense cliffhangers, but I'm still in the Harry Potter favor because Harry still seems to have fun and is not continuously depressed while attending Hogwarts. Though, if you like to read short books and aren't into the magic craze I'm sure you'll enjoy The Series of Unfortunate Events."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews

I read it aloud to my youngest and the oldest wanted to listen.  We're now 3/4 of the way through the second book, and they love it just as much.  Why?  Because they know it's not meant to be taken seriously. I find it amusing that one reviewer here who was seeking something for her child between Harry Potter books was outraged that Klaus is struck by Count Olaf.  That doesn't seem nearly as disturbing as when one of the Harry Potter characters cuts off his own hand and slits Harry's after a teen is murdered in the last Potter book. Although the children in The Bad Beginning get into dire circumstances, this book has an unmistakable sense of humor and is more along the lines of the unfortunate childhoods in all of Dickens's novels.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

They are then placed in the hands of the villian, Count Olaf, who is constantly trying to get his hands on the fortune the Baudelaire parents left behind.  Read about the elaborate plan that Olaf has cooked up in this installment of the series.  I feel that I must describe each charater since this is the first book.

Violet Baudelaire- the eldest Baudelaire-I beleive 14 in this book- who is quiet possibly the best inventor in her age group ever.

Klaus Baudelaire- the middle Baudelaire and a great researcher and bookworm.

Sunny Baudelaire- The youngest of the Baudelaires(a toddler) who has four very large teeth that enjoy to bite.

Count Olaf- the criminal and actor who, along with his theater troupe, terrorize the Baudelaires throughout the seies.  He seems to have an unhealthy interest in eyes. Are they even eyes? Hmm...

Mr. Poe- Th banker in charge of the orphans affairs.  He is always in need of a tissue.

If you think the kindly judge next door is going to save the orphans and live happily ever after you are wrong. In fact, no adult helps the orphans at all in the series so far."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews

You may be wary at first of the dark themes put forth, but, as the story progresses, you'll be amazed at how smart your children are and how well they take in the fact that sometimes life is extremely hard and sad. The children in the series lose their parents in the first few pages, but, because of the circumstances surrounding their deaths and the wealth they leave behind, the children have no time to deal with that horrible loss. Instead, they are bombarded with vile villains and sinister plots. They pull together, and, with the use of their individual strengths and the strength they gain from each other, they come through unscathed...well, sort of. The books are a delight to read. As the series goes along, the story unfolds into a clever conspiracy that you and your children will certainly enjoy. Be cautioned, though. If you find that your children love the books, and you loathe them, it may mean that your children are already smarter than you.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews

But no matter what, you can still find the answer to your problem. But as for the Baudelaire children, it's more than just a misadventure, it's a misjourney. They're encounter a shocking family tragedy, a devious count,  and a fortune that could soon be in the wrong hands.
in the book, we meet the three Baudelaire children who have lost their loving parents and their home in a dangerous fire. Violet, the oldest child who has a talent of making inventions with anything. Klaus, the middle child who loves to read and and can remember it all when he need it. Leaving Sunny, who is the infant sibling and she likes to bite things with her sharp baby teeth. With no place left to go, their only family friend Mr.Poe sends them to a family member they've never heard of. He is Count Olaf, a sneaky and devious man who keeps them only in interest of their family, and while he plans to get it in any way possible, the three Baudelaire kids will have to go through many bad events in order to survive their new home.
I read the first book back in the fifth grade and I immediately got hooked on the series. It combines the adventurous thrills and even a little bit of black humor. Kids will find the series totally irresistible and will stop to see what will happen next to the Baudelaires. To me, these series may be the best for kids to read. What will happen next would be very unfortunate, indeed.

The author promises to provide a very sad tale with NO happy ending, and further tempts you to put the book down if you cannot deal with this.

Forget about it--the lives of the Baudelaire children are worse! After devouring the first five books in a flash--the word ""devouring"" here does not mean that we hastily gobbled them up, but rather that we were compelled to read them rapidly in succession--we immediately e-bought Book 6, ""The Ersatz Elevator"" and Book 7, ""The Vile Village.""  Lemony Snicket's unrelenting(ly funny) account of the misfortunes that befall the Baudelaires is never watered down by saccharine solutions, trust us. Kids 8 and up will find every book in the series hilariously morose and intriguing, including the author's different photos, bios and letters at the end of each book.  Parents and teachers will appreciate the unique and humorous way in which Mr. Snicket introduces new vocabulary to young readers.  For reasons that remain unclear to us even now, we may never know Lemony Snicket as well as we know JK Rowling, but hopefully his series will contine to get even better, or should I say, worse?"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

This is the story of the Baudelaire's. To say that nothing goes right for them is an understatement. They face death, attempted murder, abuse, hunger, etc., etc. As each new trial, here meaning bad thing that happens to them, comes up, though, the three Baudelaire's lean on each other to come through the difficulty.
That's the great thing about the book. The children go through so many horrible things, mainly caused by Count Olaf, and yet they learn ways to trudge ahead using their intelligence, their humor, and their love for one another. The lessons taught are important for anyone to learn. Bad things do happen, but it is possible to survive and to be happy - especially since there is someone in the world who will love you and help you. The great lessons here are taught in a really interesting, humorous, and exciting story. I really recommend A Bad Beginning to everyone, and I am really looking forward to reading the rest of this series."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

What Bad Beginning?|15-Sep-18|"A Series of Unfortunate Events are the most intriguing children's books you can find out there. And not just intriguing, because they're splendidly written and cleverly plotted and woefully humorous as well. Lemony Snicket, the rather grim and depressing narrator, tells a story in the not-so-commonly-used third-person omniscient narrative form, and does so with an amusingly crafty skill. I can only encourage you to read these books.

  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are certainly not your most average kids. For starters, they are being hounded by a creepy, evil criminal that is their very distant relative, who wants to grab the ginormous Baudelaire fortune--by any means possible. Count Olaf is an undoubtedly decidedly despicable genius who always seems to get out of everything, literally everything. The kids aren't so fortunate. For only very recent orphans, the Baudelaires have somehow managed to stay strong as a united front, and their own cleverness is a match for all Olaf's scheming.

  The dry, gravely-intoned humor was very well taken. I especially enjoyed the way the longer, more troubling words were justified by their very interesting defining method-- the narrator just pops it outright like a dictionary convinced that the world is soon to end. Which is kind of what seems to be Count Olaf's plan.

  All in all, great start to a great series! (Or a bad beginning to an unfortunate series, whatever.) Our local library had only books one through eight and there are in total thirteen, a fact which did not make me a happy camper. My sister and I finished reading them and pretty much forgot about them until we found books five through eight (all three of which we've read, ha) in our very own house (thanks a lot, life) and resolved to have our library order the rest. :)

  Read A Series of Unfortunate Events. Just please. Do it."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

Now I can't wait for her to finish reading it, so I can buy the next one. The illustration on the cover and in the book are quite charming. The children are quite likable without sounding too cute, and I personally enjoy the way the author uses the book to help children learn the meaning of some words.  This is not a happy, cheerful story, but I think it's helpful for children to know not everything goes according to plan in this world. If anything I recommend reading it with your children and discuss the various topics (grief, greed, trust,etc) in the story.

Thompson|Not Sure Whether to Laugh or Cry|23-Jan-03|"This is excellent writing. Mr. Snicket is as strong a children's writer as I have seen in a while! His writing style asks you to think, while your holding your sides laughing. These books are so cleverly written. The humor ranges from subtle to ironic to obvious. This book made me laugh out loud, more than a few times and that doesn't happen a whole lot...
Poor Klaus, Violet and Sunny. You can't help but laugh at their misfortune. The understated way that the author tells about that horrible day when they lost their family and the series of unfortunate events kicked off by that day is brilliant. His style is the best since Roald Dahl. I loved all of Dahl's books, and have enjoyed each of these books so far! If you like understated, dry, ironic humor then you will love these books.
Lemony Snicket has such a great sense of timing he knows how to be self- referential without being ridiculous. The inside jokes are great. They really make you feel like you are part of something.
Enjoy this book... it is so sad it's funny!

They are purportedly children's books but the author has a wicked sense of humor, and includes references that only adults would recognize. (For example, two of the three children are named Sunny and Klaus. Gee, that makes me think about some real-life wicked goings-on.)
Aside from everything else, these children actually come alive; they're inventive, clever and resourceful. They also suffer at the hands of their wonderfully conceived evil uncle Count Olaf.
I've passed these books along to a number of children who gobbled them up as avidly as I did--which proves that a good book knows no age barriers.

I just want you to know that they are all entirely correct; if you're looking for a bland and sickeningly cheerful story where against all possibility everything magically turns out right in the end, you should very well heed the warning on the back of the book, put it in some forgotten dresser, and pick up Harry Potter or its like.  Just take care so as Lord Voldemort doesn't frighten you.
However, if you are a more strong-stomached reader, one who enjoys books where bad things happen to good people on the first page, where it's darkest just before it goes pitch-black, and where, just when it looks entirely hopeless, the villain has your baby sister in a birdcage, than you'll enjoy this book immensely.  And remember, these are fictional characters, so there is nothing morally wrong with laughing at their misfortune.
Buy this book.  Buy the series.  Buy the Unauthorized Autobiography.  Than get some Terry Pratchett.

It's not like any other kids book. It's got a little humor, a little mystery, a little adventure all wrapped into one sad book. It's the first book in one of the best children's book series, and one of the best in the series (actually there all good). It's a must-read!

The cons:

none really. It's a great book!

The pros:

It has the keep-reading factor. You know those books you start and Finnish in one day. This is one of them. Every time I put the book down I would find myself picking it back up again ten minutes later. No part of it is boring, and once you start it you won't stop.

It's unique. Like I said earlier is not like any other kids book. There are times when you can't stop laughing and times you want to cry. The plot is different than anything and the characters are some of the best.

  This book is great for readers 7 and up. If your looking for a new series to read then this book is just for you.

It's a gloomy book that makes you glad that you have a warm, comfy home...even when it's hot and sunny outside.
It contains the story of the Baudelaire orphans: Violet, an inventor; Klaus, a bookworm; and Sunny, who likes to bite things. Their parents have just died in a mysterious fire, and the children are being sent to their nearest relative, a certain Count Olaf, whom they have never met.
Count Olaf leads a troupe of actors, and, like in the plays he performs, all may not be as it seems in his large, lonely house. How, exactly, is Count Olaf related to them? And did he have anything to do with their parents' death? The orphans don't know, but one thing's for sure: strange things are happening, and their parents' demise may be only the first in a Series of Unfortunate Events...

It is called '' The Bad Beginning'' by Lemony Snicket.  It is the 1st book of ''A Series of Unfourtunate Events''.  It tells about the lives of 3 unlucky children:  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudilaire who start out as 3 rich, happy children.  Then one day they learn their parents and their mansion were destroyed in a fire.  After a few days, they are sent to live with the worst guardian imaginable:  Count Olaf.  He is an evil, greedy, murderous man who wants to kill them and steal the fortune their parents left behind.  He also has horrible looking assistants who help him with his evil schemes.  I would recommend this book to lots of people because even though it is completely and utterly miserable, it still has lots of imagination and humor.

As you will find out in the very first chapter, the Baudelaire children (Violet, Sunny, and Klaus) experience a very unfortunate event. I will not specifically tell you what happens because I don't want to ruin it. Besides, you'll find out soon enough!
Because of this unfortunate event, Violet, Sunny, and Klaus are forced to live with a relative. Mr. Poe, a man that will utterly annoy you later in the series, helps find their relative. The Baudelaire children end up living with Count Olaf, a very, very, distant relative. I can't begin to describe what he looks like or what he acts like because it would hurt you both physically and mentally. It would also ruin the fun of this book.

This book begins with this interesting choice of words from the author. ""If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better of reading some other book. In this book not only is there no happy ending there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle."" This book is about three kids, Violet, the oldest sibling, is an inventor; Klaus, the middle child, is a researcher and a reader; and Sunny, has four very sharp teeth, and likes to bite things. This book begins with these three kids on Briny Beach, receiving the news that their parents along with their mansion and all their possessions have been destroyed. After this they are forced to live with one of their relatives named Count Olaf, who makes them do chores that you wouldn't make a child do, like cut firewood or paint a house. While being talented the orphans are also inheritors of a huge fortune that they will get when Violet turns eighteen, and Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get it.

In my opinion this book is the best book of all time. It is great because of how Lemony Snicket writes the book; he builds suspense throughout the story, and adds new twists into the plot. Another thing that makes this book so great is just how sad and depressing it can be but still have some points of happiness. One other thing that makes this book so great is that it discusses real life issues like, child abuse, adoption, and the amount of power a parent should have over a kid."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews

they are not harry potter.  the comparisons alone are ridiculous. they're not even remotely similar.  apparently, a ""reviewer"" can find two books in the same store, one of them being harry potter, and proceed to lambast the non-potter book solely on the fact that they co-exist.  i just have to roll my eyes, shake my head, and write a review whenever i see this.
by now, you know the plot of these books.  yes, they're pretty much the same, and yet they're different.  i think you need to gauge your own child's sense of the morose before opting to read these to them.  older children, i think, will delight in them, particularly those with a slightly twisted sense of humor.

In short, this book was much shorter in length than what I once believed, but the tragedy, humor, and the constant urging of Snicket to put down this book are all fondly here. This is one of those series of books that, should I have children, I will gladly read aloud with much gusto.

Great reading for children who have learned to read on their own. Readers will enjoy parts like pg.94 where Klaus ""found himself reading the same sentenece over and over"", as well as the explaintory phrases for introducing words like rickety (pg. 2) (Of course, be sure to look up nefarious and fiendish, since the author does not supply this with definitions. It would be fun to use it as a class activity though.)

With A Series of Unfortunate Events, though, I found myself turning each page with wonderful anticipation each and every time. I honestly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Harry Potter series. Before reading this book, I feared that it would be a disgraceful copy of the Harry Potter series but to my surprise, it was actually a very diverse and eye-catching book that turned out to be one of my favorites. I have now read every single book in the Series of Unfortunate Events excepting book #9, The Carnivorous Carnival, and I do not regret any of the time spent reading them at all. I had a fantastic adventure diving into each and every story and spending the day with Violet, Klaus, Sunny, Count Olaf, and all of the other hilarious as well as fascinating and interesting characters that add so much to the humor as well as to the beautiful plot that keeps us all going. Lemony Snicket has such a way with words that can keep any child's eyes glued to the pages. Snicket's writings add to any reader's vocabulary in a whole new motivating and efficient way while at the same time keeping a smile on their faces. The way that he digresses into his own adventurous and rebellious life keeps us tantalized to his amazing stories. Although I am only one person, I can speak for many other readers of The Bad Beginning and the other stories in the Series of Unfortunate Events by saying that I am caught between the stories of the Baudelaires and of Lemony Snicket. There are times when Snicket starts to digress into his own life when I think, ""Stop talking about yourself; get back to the mysterious and tempting plot of the Baudelaire children!"" but then I find myself tied up in the middle of Snicket's life instead! There are so many examples of this in action that anyone can find just by reading these books and these examples are those that make the stories so wonderful and attractive.

In a world were ""there is nothing to eat in the house"" is too typically just code for ""there is nothing in the house I am in the mood for"" this book could potentially offer a shift of perspective for young readers. The writer knows a lot about rhetorical analysis, so this book series might also be useful for kids to learn about the darker sides of communication, which will face them in different situations for the rest of their lives. The bright side of the story is that no matter how unreal the pain and suffering becomes in the lives of the Baudelaire children, they take care of one another and adamantly refuse to take things out on each other.

This might not be the right story book for your kid, each one is unique and needs individual attention and care. This might be a good book to read along with your child, because many of life's more difficult issues will come into focus while reading it, it could be a chance to talk with your young reader about those issues.

Let me know if this helps anyone. Morgan."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

My criticism of Snicket, and I think it is a strength of the tale as well, is that the story stresses that the Baudelaires have only each other. The children are constantly dismissed when they reach out to adults for assistance, even as their lives are at stake. They are gradually learning (it seems it will become a theme in the series) to not trust others, and the others are always adults. For me, as a young adult it is heartbreaking to realize that children should not reach for help from strange adults, and they must quickly develop the ingenuity to save their own skins in case you might not be their to help them (as the Baudelaire's parents died), or even more tragically, if you ignore them yourself.

While I would like to see fiction foster a world that is always ready to greet children with warm rooms and adults who are excited to learn from them I know that is not representative of the world we live in. So while I wish The Bad Beginning gave us one competent adult who didn't dismiss the children, that is not the case, especially in the welfare system, which is where the Baudelaires find themselves.

One appreciates how Snicket's tales illustrate the sanctuary children have when they defend each other, and actually risk their own lives to help the group. What is also fantastic is the Baudelaires do not act on a whim - Violet (hurray its a girl character) is very interested in science and engineering and she logically invents contraptions that get them out of jams while Klaus's photographic memory retains random pieces of knowledge to help get the plans off the ground.

The Baudelaires camaraderie is refreshing and in a way it exists already in the rebelliousness of youth - how we refuse to get each other in trouble - we'll all take detention rather than rat someone out, the substitute teacher is the common enemy. But wouldn't it be fantastic if it didn't disappear into our adulthood? Then Snicket wouldn't have to tell us the nightmarish tale of the Baudelaires. Because the first adult to hear their story would have put a stop to the anguish they were facing and brought them into fantastic home to nurture Violet's inventions, Klaus's reading, and baby Sunny's biting."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews

What more could you ask for? I have really enjoyed this book. Lemony's book is a must read. It has all the qualities of a bestselling book. What's more it will soon become a Netflixs original series. Violet is an amazing peice of work. Smart and strategic, she could invent her way out of everything! Klaus is the brains of the children. His knowledge of just about everything will be very useful later on ;). Sunny is a interesting character. The youngest of the three siblings, she is often the first target for Count Olafs schemes. She is a brilliant invention. Now Olaf is a different person entirely. Cunning, cruel and ambitious,  he will stop at nothing to get the giant fortune in the bank.

Swanson|The Bad Beginning truly perfectly begins the series|2-Jan-01|"I was hooked on the series before I even saw this book, having first seen the next two succeeding volumes in a bookstore. The idea of unfortunate events in the world of children was reminiscent of the ones I used to create while still a child, (do you have bad dreams that are a relief to wake up from?  did you fantasize alternate courses for your existence to take?  If so, this is your book!) so of course I had to read the _Series of Unfortunate Events_.
Lemony Snicket apologizes in each book for the sad events contained therein, but at the risk of upsetting the intro, I'd like to add that in some ways the books are every bit as encouraging as they are unhappy.  A common complaint with books in a series is that they often don't stand well alone -- have no fear.  This book is a complete story in itself.  I warn you, however, that you will most likely end up hooked too, and have to read the whole series anyway.
_The Bad Beginning_ was perfect, right down to the surprise ending and the hoped for, but impossible happy solution offered by Justice Strauss.
Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent, resourceful, and kind, but from the opening pages, you'll see that their good qualities are all the good luck they seem to have.  They are orphaned right away and sent to live with a series of people.  In this book, you are with them when they learn of their parents' death, and you get the same foreboding feeling about Count Olaf as the children have. Violet can invent almost anything she needs for a sticky situation. Klaus, a voracious reader, knows almost every word there is, and is invaluable as a researcher.  Sunny, with those teeth of hers, could be a bodyguard despite her tender age. The special skills of each orphan come brilliantly into play for the resolution of this story.  I thought by the end, that I knew how the children would escape from the Count's evil plan to inherit the Baudelaire fortune, but I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong about that.
Buy it.  You'll like it.  Your 12 year old neice will like it.  By the time you've seen the second book, you'll also be wondering who Beatrice is, and hanging on to the clues given to that seemingly unrelated thread in each book.  I also want to add that the volumes of the series are beautifully presented in the physical printed binding way, as if they're destined to become treasured antiques, and why wouldn't they be, after all?"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

Scott West|A quick but satisfying read....|12-Feb-03|"This was a fun book to read. At a short 160 pages, I was able to read it in one quick setting and look forward to reading the others in the series.
My son, age 7, received this series as a Christmas present. He finished the first book, which he read quickly, and started to tell me some of the plot line. Well, my wife and I decided that I better read this book to make sure it was okay for a seven year old.
Nothing good happens to these poor children throughout the entire book, but, the events happen in such curious ways, and the writer places much wit into the scenarios that I felt it was fine for him to continue the series. I will say that I believe that it is important for a parent to sit down with their child before allowing them to read this book and explain that it is all in fun. I did this with my son and then he felt better about it.
I think that the big problem now will be who gets the next book first!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews

Such a great story. Lemony Snicket rocks!
The interesting thing I found about this  book was that it was hard not to imagine it taking place in the past, yet  modern conveniences would pop-up unexpectedly to remind me it was more of a  present setting.
A part of me wishes these were written for us older  folks. The constant explanation of what things mean is so great for kids,  but not as fun for us adults.
However, I love them and the fact that he  refuses to put in the gushy happy ending that everyone expects. It makes it  more realistic.
That's the thing I love the most about these books, the  author has created a full world complete with his ""author"" Lemony  Snicket. So fun and interesting.
It's also nice to see a girl who does  something with her mind."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

Stringini|Wow... Really Good Stuff|18-Jun-04|"I have to say, childrens books these days are just amazing.  I'm almost 20, and read constantly, and yet every once in a while I pick up books like Harry Potter, or in this case, A Series of Unfortunate Events.  I have to say, these books are more inventive, more intelligent, and more fun to read than most books coming out intended for adults.  These books don't care about being silly, and creating a world that isn't linked to the real one, because the audience for these books wouldn't really care.  They allow themselves to be totally pulled in to these wonderful, and in this case dark, worlds.  Adults on the other hand... not so much.  They get caught up in the ""that can't happen"" or the ""that's not right.""  Oh well.
As this book goes, it's a winner.  Not only is the story amazing, but it also tends to be written at a very high reading level, and yet takes time to explain words to it's young readers, helping expand their vocabularies.  That, in and of itself, should make any parent pick up these books.  Your kids will be learning like crazy! It even helped my vocabulary, which is funny, since I haven't learned so many amazing words, and I'm in college, and studying english!  Plus, the characters are amazing, and very good role models.  Pick up this book soon.  Recomended for both adults and children."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews

As the author plainly writes, those searching for a happy ending will be disappointed. Written in a style that is easy enough for late elementary or early middle school, the book obviously found an audience. Still, it is the wry sense of humor that attracts the older crowd.

The Baudelaire children are in a desperate situation when a fire consumes both their parents and their home. By their parents' will, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are given to the custody of their relative in the closest proximty. The mysterious Count Olaf is hardly child-friendly and soon reveals his true motives. He seeks possession of the Baudelaire fortune which can only be accessed when the eldest comes of age. In the mean time, he intends to use the children as servants catering to his miscellaneous needs. That is, until he unleashes a plot to expedite his acquiring the fortune.

Help comes in the form of their new neighbor Judge Strauss and the often oblivious Mr. Poe. In the big pitcure, the solution comes down to the superior intellect of the Baudelaire children. Violet and Klaus come to the defense of the infant Sunny. And while a solution is reached for the current problem, do not expect a happy ending."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

Violet, Krause, and Sunny are horrified to find that their parents have died and that they are left orphans. They inherit the Baudlaire fortune, however, and, as their parents wished, they are sent to live with a distant cousin.
Once at Count Olaf's grimy home, they are even more in despair, especially when he is terribly cruel and plots to steal their fortune. What can these clever children do to save themselves?
This was an entertaining, humorous book that grabs you as soon as you read the title! Be sure to read the others in the series (""The Reptile Room"", etc.) and I'm sure you'd also enjoy the popular ""Harry Potter"" books, about another unlucky boy, filled with more British humor."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews

When we went on errands, they even asked if they could stay in the car and listen while I did what I had to do.

We loved it!! It was silly, educational, and entertaining all at once, with suspense thrown in. The boys' favorite character is Sunny, while I rather like Violet.

Especially engaging was the multicast recording.  We have since missed this in the subsequent Lemony Snicket audiobooks.

I want to warn those who have seen the SOUE film:  Expect something different in the books.  The film combined three books, and not very well.

She couldn't wait to get into bed and I found myself not wanting to stop reading to her most evenings. These books are so  enjoyable and educational as well (the author uses large vocabulary words for young children but always defined the words using terms that children could understand easily.) My daughter loved using her newfound ""adult"" words around the house, school, and the playground, in fact, most children (and even some adults) didn't know the definition of many of her new vocabulary words (which she loved.) These books not only educated her but also helped pave the way for her being such a success in school. She wanted to reread the stories from the prior evening but had to finish homework before I would allow her to do so. She would fly through homework to devour her books. Thank you Lemony Snicket aka Daniel Handler! She currently has a 4.0 GPA and did not before these books came into our lives. Coincidence?

And their distant relative, named Count Olaf that is trying to steal their fortune. Good thing these three little kids are very smart. And there is this lady that always there to help them. That person is Justice Strauss.
Count Olaf has to take care of these Baudelaire kids. Then he thinks of trying to steal the Baudelaire fortune with his associates. He thinks of trying to steal it by trying to marry the oldest child, Violet Baudelaire legally. Then Klaus goes to Justice Strauss's library to figure out everything he could about marriage.
Then it is the day when they have to perform the play where everyone is invited. But Sunny couldn't make it because she was hanging at the rooftop of Count Olaf's house. But his plan all goes wrong when Violet doesn't sign the paper with her correct hand. The Count Olaf escapes with his associates and everything is fine. But where are the Baudelaire children going to live?
I liked this book because it is exciting and kind of has some adventure. I also liked this book because the kids are brilliant and like to work as hard as they could. Violet is good at mechanics or inventing things. Klaus likes to read a lot and is good at looking for information and also understanding difficult words. He can also solve puzzles that are difficult. Sunny is creative by using her four sharp teeth. This was a really great book and I recommend every one of fifth to eighth graders to read this book."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Bad Beginning, the first in the Series of Unfortunate Events, by Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler) with illustrations by Bret Helquist (magnificent) is a most fantastic book to be enjoyed by all ages (though, perhaps, mostly teens to adults).  Children below 12 or 13 might find this book more enjoyable read aloud.
The book is filled with dead-pan dark comedy that claims no happy ending, but, in reality, follows the archetypal story pattern as well as any other children's book.  There is the thrust of the Baudelaire children into the care of a distant relative (distant by blood, not proximity), Count Olaf, a dastardly man of the world.  The orphans pine after the freedom, comfort, protection, and library of home, finding a replacement in a Judge next door.  Count Olaf schemes to take the orphans' wealth (which they cannot touch until Violet, the eldest, comes of age).  The plan in thwarted by the orphans' intelligence and pluck, but their hopes of living with the Judge are also thwarted by the well-meaning, but impossibly stupid Mr. Poe - the family solicitor.  The orphans find themselves on their way to another relative's home - that of Montgomery Montgomery.
The Bad Beginning, like the other books in the series, are filled with large words and complex situations designed to teach younger people.  Mr. Snicket purposely uses big words, so he can define them in a non-teaching sort of way.  It seems only natural that he explain what words and ideas used by the adults in the book really mean - like nuptial law or puttanesca.  It is not dumbed-down or trite or like very other children's story.  It was a delight to read for this 22-year old English major, and I've got many of my friends now reading them, too.
I did, however, wonder to myself what the children I bring into this world might think of the stories.  My conclusion was that I would most probably hold off telling these stories until they were around 8 or 9, because some of the concepts and ideas are much too broad-reaching.  An explanation of one situation might well lead into a discussion over any number of requisite ideas necessary for understanding such a thing as, say nuptial law.  I do not believe in sheltering children from many things, especially in literature, but even I must say that it might be a more enjoyable book for older readers.  Enjoyment, is after all, the primary reason for reading."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

Yes the book has a dark theme,  but the author is wickedly funny, and the children are strong and find inventive ways to foil the bad guys. It teaches lessons about resilience and strength when bad things happen to good people. But mostly it is just hysterically funny.  Everyone wants to know what happens next,  and everyone is laughing. My son loved the covers, and collected all the books. Get the audios too - Tim Curry is simply perfect. Excellent series. If your kids aren't sheltered and don't scare easily, they will love these books. And their parents will too.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews

Then for my birthday I got a gift certificate to Barnes & Noble and decided to buy the first two (don't ask why, because that's still a mystery to me), and boy am I glad that I did.

  I absolutely love these books. I have read all of them, including the newest one, The Penultimate Peril. These books get better and better as they go along, as well as bigger. I enjoyed the last one more than the others, but not by a lot. I was rather disappointed when I heard there is only one more.

  One thing I have to say: I hate how these book websites say most of these books are for kids 9-12, or grades 5-6. I think books that are labeled '9-12' are better than most young adult books. I'm fifteen, and I enjoy these books. I enjoy most every book I read that is supposedly recommmended for kids 9-12. I find it very discouraging, and often I find myself not reading a book just because it says ages 9-12. I wish they'd not put an age recommendation on books. Someone said they feel the same way, so they never read books labeled that. Please, GET RID of the age recommendations.

  But anyway, I totally recommend this book, and the rest of the series."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews

In his book, The Bad Beginning, he introduces a handful of suspicious, creepy, curious, intelligent, and ultimately, heart-warming characters.  Both Violet and Klaus, the two older Baudelaire orphans are good role-models for little Sunny, their baby sister.  Despite their parents dying, the children are still doing well - that is of course until they meet Count Olaf, an evil relative who is not only rude and conniving, but he is also trying to steal the Baudelaire fortune (the money that the orphans will inherit from their deceased parents).
People should read whatever they want, but this is an extraordinary book, and I highly recommend it.  Books like this are mysterious and wondrous.  At the end of each chapter it will keep you wondering what happened next!  For instance, at the end of chapter eight, when Klaus and Violet are looking for Sunny, Count Olaf appears in the doorway to their room and smirks menacingly.  Then the chapter ends, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
Everybody can like this book, especially if they like mystery and suspense and little kids getting tortured (but I hope no one likes little kids getting tortured!)  Stuff like that is why I like this book.  This book is good for all ages, but I would highly recommend it for ages 11 and up."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews

The ending, I must say, was quite surprising as I was expecting much different, but it was very good anyway, and I won't spoil it for potential readers. The realistic cleverness and daring of the characters makes you feel as though you could actually come across the Baudelaires in real life, and perhaps not even recognise them!

Count Olaf is dreadful and Violet, Klaus, and Sonny are intelligent, resourceful children who just can't catch a break! The story line is so outrageous that it's not too scary or sad...just great fun. And as I teacher I love the constant vocabulary lessons that are intertwined into the story.

When I first read a description of this book, I was intrigued as to an author writing unfortunate happenings in a children's book. Reading the entire book in a quick read, I found the story to be very captivating and entirely different from any other book that I have previously read.

It all starts on a dull day at Briny Beach where Violet, Klaus and Sunny, the three Baudelaire children receive news that they parents had passed away in their home when it burnt down and all their belongings perished. Things worsen when they are sent to live with Count Olaf, a mean old man who is a distant relative of their parents, and who has other plans for the children rather than taking care of them.

Lemony Snicket has a wonderful way of keeping the reader absorbed in the story. Just when you expect something good to happen for the children, the author puts them in another drastic situation. Yet in the end of this book, you feel relieved as well as sorry for the Baudelaire children as you do not know what unfortunate events they are likely to encounter in the future.

There are many people who seem to enjoy this series of Lemony Snicket's work and I wouldn't disagree. I am 20 years old studying in college and I know several people studying with me who enjoy reading the series. However, I wouldn't recommend telling these stories to young toddlers, such as kids under the ages of 5-6 as they might find it a little too scary to cope up with. No child wants to know about parents burning in a house, or about a bad man like Count Olaf who makes the children do tedious chores, or about a man with hooks for hands who even made me feel a little scared!

All in all, I found this book as a wonderful read and cannot wait to get started on the next one."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

What a guilty pleasure to revel in their misery.  The series begins with a fire destroying their home and killing their parents.  Then things get worse.  Forced to live with the the scheming Count Olaf, it is soon apparent that the Count is only interested in the Baudelaire fortune, which he attempts to gain my marrying young Violet.

The book is accessable to readers of all levels, as vocabulary words are introduced and defined in a non-condesending way in a story line that is riveting.

This author doesn't write ""down"" to kids. I kept thinking, as one horrible thing after another happened to these kids, that the book was too strong, violent, and scary for kids. But then I remembered how violent fairy tales are, how sad and scary ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"" were. Kids can take it -- in fact, they love it!

""The Bad Beginning"",starts off the dismal adventures of the Baudelaire children and their quest to defeat their wicked uncle Count Olaf,and his evil schemes,and numerous minions. It also begins the mystery surrounding Mr.Lemony Snicket,and why he is compelled to write these adventures,and why he is running from the authorities!( Not to mention the mystery surrounding the very dead Beatrice! )
Childrens books? Hardly. These are for ""big kids""! Not many children will catch the numerous literary references. (i.e. ""Baudelaire"",or ""Sunny & Klaus"" ( as in ""Von Bulow"" )or ""Isadora & Duncan Quagmire"",or Mr.Poe,whom constantly coughs into his handkerchief, and his son Edgar,or Uncle Monty whom owns a collection of snakes,etc. ). Not to mention the series promises 13 books,all with 13 chapters.
The plots are comical and silly,and a great distraction for those whom like a good laugh,at the expense of some downtrodden orphans.( And who doesn't? )
How can you not be drawn to a book,whos very dust jacket implores you NOT to read it? Like a bad habit with your name on it,once you begin,you'll crave more and more!
I recommend this series for anyone with a sense of humour or your favorite goth girl or guy!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews

Seeing as both of us are college graduates I felt that reading a book intended for 10 to 12-year-old kids might not be our cup of tea. But listening to Tim Curry's fantastic narration of the first chapter kept us captivated enough to go through the entire first book. The brilliance of the story telling lies mainly in the fact that it can be understood at different levels. For the kids there's the plane good vs evil idea of the mean villain trying to steal the money. From an adult point of view there's the very disturbing gruesome sexual undertone which makes the read a very disturbing one. But scattered throughout the book are the very funny/sarcastic observations that lighten the mood and keep you laughing hard at even the darkest points. Being a huge Terry Pratchett fan I find some of Terry's sense of humour and social observation in this book, even if no one that reviews this seems to agree with me on this. I doubt that I'll be committed enough to read all 13 books in the series but this one was a fantastic entertainment for a relaxing Sunday. Tim Curry's simply one of the best readers imaginable and the audio cd is a true masterpiece.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews

But on a particularly cloudy day at Briny Beach, their lives are shattered-The word shattered here means, ""Their lives were ruined like a window being broken into a million pieces."" The curious Lemony Snicket uses this new approach to grammar and definition to tell the tale of the three Baudelaires, (Sunny, Klaus, and Violet) who were once the most fortunate children ever. In a heartbeat, everything changes. A fire consumes the Baudelaires' house, and their parents' lives. The well-intentioned, yet slightly daft, Mr. Poe now has the responsibility to find the Baudelaire children, now the Baudelaire orphans, a new home. He soon finds them shelter with a distant relative, who doesn't live so distant from the Baudelaire's old home. His name is Count Olaf, an evil man who is only keeping the children for his own benefit. The greedy count wants to steal their immense fortune, which Violet will inherit in four more years. In their first unfortunate adventure, the children encounter the friendly Justice Strauss, Count Olaf's cruel acting troupe, a very helpful cookbook, and a play with a script that could ruin it all. Will the quick minds of the orphans prevail, or will Count Olaf grab the fortune and win the game? Once I finished book one, I was begging for book two. Lemony Snicket's humorous writings are amazingly captivating from the first word to the last, a rare trait found in only the best books. Make sure if you read book one, you have book two and maybe even book three near by just to be safe, because even though these books are full of adventure and excitement, you'll find them to be quicker than you thought...unfortunately."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews

I have heard some people complaining that these books are depressing.  Maybe you should examine the title or you could read a book about ponies.  This book is very humorous.  That is if you get Lemony Snicket's humor.  It is the best book in the series as far as Count Olaf's plots to steal their fortune.  It is very creative.  If only they could live with Justice Strauss.  Then again did you really think the book would have a good ending?

WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  The multiple voices really made the story come alive.  It felt like we were actually in a theatre. I have this entire series on audio; this one is tremendously superior.  While all have voice performers, the others are merely ""read"" in comparison; this one is ""acted.""  We read along with a lot of audio books in my classroom; it is very effective for accommodating multiple learning styles.  I received the greatest student response and more positive feedback regarding this audio book than any other (and we have read some phenomenal books).  The only problem I had was that it was SO FUNNY that I had to repeatedly remind my students that we had to ""laugh respectfully"" so we did not disturb our neighboring classroom; that's actually a compliment to the awesomeness to this recording.  I utterly captivated a classroom of co-ed fifth graders.

They all have different interests. Violet is the oldest in the family. She is 14, and likes to invent stuff. Klaus is the second oldest. He likes to read. Everything he reads, he remembers. Sunny is very young. She likes to bite things.

Their parents died in a fire which destroyed the whole house. A banker named Mr. Poe took the kids to this horrible man named Count Olaf. They got a great number of horrible chores every day. But Mr. Poe thinks Olaf does not do anything wrong. So one day, Count Olaf decided to put on a play to get his hands on the fortune. And the play was about a marriage and Violet was the bride and Count Olaf was the groom. And Sunny was locked up in a cage. So Klaus decided to rescue Sunny first. Then as soon as he got Sunny out of there, Violet was coming down the aisle. When the signing sheet came, Violet wrote with her left hand so she was safe. Now Mr. Poe knows how horrible he is. My favorite part of The Bad Beginning was when Violet foiled Count Olaf's plot. My mom enjoys this book too, so I think it's a book for all ages.

So I trudged to the bookstore and bought _The Bad Beginning_ (read the title with a dark, raspy voice--it makes me laugh).  I didn't really love the series until I read the second and subsequent books, but they truly are delightful!  Yes, they're rather dark and somewhat morbid, but they're also funny and lighthearted at times.  The wonderful relationship the three Baudelaire children have with each other is something I'd like to see more often in siblings.  They work together, and they apologize when they say mean things unintentionally.  And they're smart, to boot!  No longer is there a stigma attached to smart children who enjoy reading or inventing or biting things!  No one else sees these hobbies as unsual or abnormal, so the reader doesn't either.  I especially like how Mr. Snicket defines words that most children will understand (though the definitions are excellent if the reader doesn't know what the word means), yet he leaves even more complicated words untouched.  The idea leaves me reaching for my dictionary every once in a while.
For me, the books only take about an hour to read, so they're a brief respites from classes and exams even while I only have a short break!
I truly wish I could make this review separate from the series as a whole, but I'm afraid I can't--the books just go together.
I don't feel that the plot is overly dark, but I'm also not 10 years old.  I can see quite plainly what is happening, and I can understand without being told that the circumstances have nothing to do with reality as it pertains to me.  For me, the point is NOT that the Baudelaire Orphans are being chased by an evil, treacherous villian--the point is that the children are intelligent, witty, and are using their resources to overcome the obstacles in their path.  Consider, Sunny teaches herself how to speak!  The Series of Unfortunate Events is an excellent series!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

How about, The Great Beginning?|18-Jul-01|The Bad Beginning was a wonderful opening to a wonderful new series. The characters are well thought out and entertaining. Anyone who calls Lemony Snicket a J.K. wanna-be is gonna have to go through me, first! I'm both a die hard Lemony Snicket and J.K. Rowling fan, and I very little that reflects on the other. Klaus is not a wanna-be Harry Potter, he's more interested in reading his books then getting killed by Voldemort, and discovered girls quite a bit before Harry. (Isadora Quagmire has his fancy...) This book is an entertaining, lively book.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews

By: Lemony Snicket
Reviewed by: B. Arihara
Period: P.1
  The Baudelaire children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are all wondering the beach when they receive terrible news that their parents have died in a fire which began in their house. Mr. Poe, the person to give them the news took care of the children until they were taken to their new father, Count Olaf. Count Olaf is a horrible evil man who is just interested in trying to get the Baudelaire fortune. He thinks of a scheme to receive the money, which can only be used by Violet when she is old enough to inherit it. Klaus eventually figures out Count Olaf's plan and tries to stop him, but instead gets them into more trouble. Olaf is going to have a play where he is the groom and Violet is the Bride. Justice Strauss, a neighbor who happens to be a judge, is the one who performed the wedding ceremony.  Once they both say their ""I do's"" and sign a piece of paper in front of a real judge, they will be officially married, which everyone thinks is just part of the play. Once they are married, Count Olaf will be able to take the Baudelaire money and dispose of the children. Unfortunately, everything has gone as planned and Violet and Count Olaf officially married as Olaf had thought. When Violet signed the piece of paper, she signed it with her left hand when she was right-handed, which means the document is invalid and they are not married. Justice Struaff arrested Count Olaf along with his assistants, and the Baudelaire children were taken away after saying their good-byes and thank-you's.
  One of the reasons why I liked this book was because the author explained, as he went along, the difficult words to understand. He saved some time for me by telling me what the words mean, so i don't have to take time and look them up in the dictionary. ""The word nuptial means relating to marriage"" is an example of his unique type of writing and so is ""The word standoffish here means reluctant to associate with others."" Also i like how Sunny always says those baby words like ""yeeka"" or ""odo yow.""
  I disliked this book because there was constantly bad things happening again and again. One after another terrible things happened to the Baudelaire children. They always got into trouble and when they thought of a plan, it was always ruined by Count Olaf or his assistants. Sometimes too many unpleasant happenings make a book not very enjoyable to read. There should be a little more happiness throughout the book.

  My favorite part of the book is in the very beginning when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are walking along the beach shore. The way the author described it made me remember all the fun times I had at the beach. I remember running in the shallow water looking for sea-shells and playing in the water trying to catch small fish with my hands or a net. The beach is probably my favorite place to go in the world. Whenever i think of the beach i think of happiness, joy, fun, and good times."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews

Marcus. And the song ""Scream and Run Away preformed by the Gothic Archies. This is also a review of the book.

Initial listening of this book brought horror and disgust (which in this case means repugnance.) Determined to finish the story despite the author's constant warnings, I must say that I became enamored of his style.

There are several pluses to listening to the recording. The pace of the recording helps keep you going when you would have set the book aside. The absence of the book's illustrations by Bret Helquist allowed you to imagine a more sinister Count Olaf and a cuter, yet with a tad of tomboy, Violet. Now the significant plus is the unmistakable voice of Tim Curry of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Oscar"" (1991 as Dr. Poole) fame. His interpretation of the voices gave just as much panache to the characters as Lemony's writing.

Not in the book, but as additions to the recording are two significant items that help with the understanding of the story, where it came from, and where it is going. First is an interview with the author. It covers many of the standard questions asked in an interview; the answers and the communication style is somewhat unique and a little over the top. Also there is a recording of a song that Mr. Snicket says is played by the Baudelaire memorial orchestra; I have since found that it was really preformed by the Gothic Archies, written by Gay and Loud.

I do not want to give away the plot however I can tell you that at one point they are forced to eat ""boiled chicken, boiled, potatoes and 'blanched'- here means 'boiled'- string beans"""|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_82?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=82&reviewerType=all_reviews

The writing style is delicious and turn of phrase comical. The series uses a lot of large words and i would consider this an excellent vocabulary builder. The kids increase their vocabulary and are exposed to writing vehicles without even knowing it.

As passionate as I am about these books, the plot does become convoluted and lose a little steam beginning at book 6, but I still consider every book worth the time to read it.

Please be aware that not all of the value edition stickers come off the book, so if it is for a gift, your recipient will know how inexpensive it was. Lucky for me, my kids didn't car.

Delighted by the tone set forth on the back cover, I was instantly caught up in the horrific events that befall the poor Beaudilaire children--and even more intrigued by the author, Mr. Lemony Snicket.  His wonderful way of explaining what words mean, the Dickensian tone of the stories, and the ""perils of Pauline"" type plot--along with the hints of what was to come in future stories, has left me a life-long Snicket fan.
It took me back to my glory days as a young reader, when I discovered an author I would read for days on end.  Since that first read, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS has become a series of joyful reads.

Contrary to the 100+ 1 star reviews, this series takes you on a sort of ""personal"" journey through the cruelty of humanity. Yes, the first book sets the morbid mood mentioning the three Baudelaire kids and how they become three lowly orphans. Yes, Count Olaf is a very bad, greedy, selfish human being and is determined on getting the orphans' inheritance. Yes, the adults have very little common sense and brain to listen to the pleas of the kids in expressing great concern to being in the care of Count Olaf.

Let's face it, things like these happen every day all over the world. No on ever really listens to a child because they think it's all their imagination. I personally love the dark, morbid, chilling mood of this series. Book after book I read in middle school. This is the series that re-introduced me to being a reader. If only there were more books out there like this one. After middle school I started leaning away from reading and leaning more towards writing. The series had inspired me to write more.

In fact, I've written an amazing screenplay, a full novel, and am working on another one. After all the years watching Disney movies with their monogamous ""Happily-Ever-After"" style of endings it became too boring and predictable. Girl finds handsome prince, conflict occurs, prince loses pretty girl (or almost loses her), true love's kiss breaks curse, they lived happily-ever-after the end.

If you're looking for something new and different to read, I would recommend this book and the rest of the series. It may not seem like the characters make too much progress in their own development or the story's development but Lemony Snicket basically wanted readers to continue on to the next book to gain more information. The kids' personalities also develop a little more with each book. In one of the books, their misfortune was so bad they almost gave up the great fight to get justice for all of the horrible things Olaf had done. I own all 13 books and it was the best use of my money."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

Now that I read the first book though, I see how much the movie hacked up the story. The movie is based on 3 of the stories and eventhough they messed with the story a lot it was still faithful to the atmosphere of the books at least. I was hoping for more sequels and since that isn't happening I hear, I decided to read the books.

  The characters are more developed in the books. Count Olaf is darker and scary and less goofy than Jim Carrey made him. Justice Strauss only had like 2 scenes in the movie when in the books, she loves the kids and the kids love her. They love reading and she lets them visit and read her books when Olaf of course has no books. While Olaf sets up an evil plan to try and get their fortune. Since he's an actor he plans a play where he'd marry Violet but with the marriage being real. This way he could kill them and get the fortune. The movie puts the play at the end when infact it happens before they meet Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine in the books.

  The books have an unpleasant and lightly goofy humor and not the over the top humor that Jim Carrey brought to the movie. The movie had a scene where Olaf left the kids in his car on train tracks hoping a train would hit the car. Although I love that scene it's not in any of the 3 first books. It's more like something you'd see in Looney Tunes than read in any of the books. At least that scene is somewhat faithful to the books though. It has Violet using her inventing skills and Klaus using the knowledge he gained from reading many books. So I can't really call the movie bad.

But then I read it all the way through! It was excellent.
  Here is a bit of the plot: The Baudelaire children - Violet, age 14 (an inventor); Klaus, age 12 (a reader) and baby Sunny (a biter) - learn that their wealthy parents have died in a huge fire that destroyed their mansion. They are then sent to live with their creepy distant relative, Count Olaf, who runs a ghastly theater troupe. Olaf makes them chop wood for no apparent reason, and prepare pasta puttanesca for his fellow actors (who all become drunk). The Baudelaires sleep in a tiny, filthy room with one bed, and with a cardboard box for a wardrobe.
  Olaf reaches the depths of his vileness when he concocts a plot to seize the children's fortune: he attempts to marry Violet, in quite a sneaky way. But Klaus (after reading up on nuptial law) alerts Violet, who gets out of the marriage in her own clever manner. Count Olaf escapes...but promises to be back (which he is, in the next book).
  Yes, this plot sounds highly disturbing. Then again, I am not Lemony Snicket, and I can't adequately describe the book's writing. Snicket goes out of his way to define words like ""garlic"" and ""anchovies"", but in a very entertaining way. He also interprets Sunny's infantile outbursts (""Gack!"" means ""Look at that shadowy creature emerging from the fog!"" or something along those lines), and makes references to his lost love, Beatrice, in random places in the book. The language is old-fashioned, one might say, but in a good way!
  Best of all, though, is the resourcefulness of the three children: they are intelligent, well-read, and generally amazing. Count Olaf, too, is so delightfully evil that the reader feels no guilt about despising him.
  However, I wouldn't recommend ""The Bad Beginning"" to anyone under ten or so - although, of course, each person is different. I an fourteen, but I only really liked this series when I was thirteen. (Then again, I think the Harry Potter books are terribly scary - although I love them - so there you are.) There are a few literary references (such as Mr. Poe's son Edgar) that younger kids might not understand, and of course, the plot is pretty scary. But I believe that anyone age eleven or above could enjoy ""The Bad Beginning,"" even adults. (I've met adults who were in love with it.)
  But of course, you should not trust me. I suggest you read it for yourself: I doubt that you will be disappointed."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

What I like about these books are that the author gets you involved and leaves a lot of questions hanging, which are up to you to solve. It's very addictive, and once you read one, you can't stop. I can understand how some people don't like them, but it's called a Series of Unfortunate Events for a reason. A lot of adults think childrens minds are all happy and sugar-coated, but that's not really true. If you like happy endings, back away.
Although the books are all about misery, I am hoping that the actual series has a good ending.

Starting from the first page, the author has us hooked. He (tho I suspect it may be a 'she') tells us not to read the book if we don't like unhappy endings and unfortunate events. Then we are introduced to three children whom he tells us lose their parents (I'm not giving anything away here - he tells us that almost immediately). The parents were wealthy, but the oldest child is 14, so they must stay with a guardian until she comes of age to inherit the fortune.  The guardian is Count Olaf and he has a master plan to nab the childrens' fortune and do away with them.  Definitely not confined to ages 9-12, I think those 12 - adult will enjoy it too.  It is reminiscent of 'Charlie & the Chocolate Factory', an ageless tale of pure reading enjoyment and wonderful illustrations.  I already read book 2 all in one day, yesterday.  I will go on to read the third and, I suspect, the entire series.

These adults seem to not understand the book at all. Which does not mean it is not a great crossover book to be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.

First of all the entire premise is delightfully original. You get hooked in knowing all the misfortune that haunts the Baudelaire children. Lemony Snicket tells you it is not something you want to read if you like sugary happy endings which makes me wonder why the idiots who gave it one star wouldn't heed this good advice.

Compared to the dull snoozefest that is Harry Potter, this is very much more entertaining, engaging and well written.

He has a way with words and with every book in the series using alliteration in the title and every one with 13 chapters to form the 13 books in the series, makes you more curious about it all. I especially enjoyed his way with explaining some words and phrases to the young reader - noteworthy being - difference between ""literally"" and ""figuratively"" and the word ""standoffish"".

Bad things indeed happen to these young ones and as in all children's book the adults don't seem to understand the evil plot until it is too late. All children's book from Enid Blyton to any book of today shows kids as the brave, enterprising, adventurous and witty ones. It is sad that some adults find this insulting but these protagonists are the ""heroes"" of the novel and if there is an adult hero in some novel, no one complains about the kids being portrayed as stupid.

The Bad Beginning starts with very bad news indeed. And the orphans now seek peace of mind in various ways. Children could learn humility, kindness, adventurousness, being polite and also grace & modesty in adversity. These kids are resourceful and stick together and know how to deal with negative and positive influences. There is a lot to learn here for kids and adults alike (especially the one-star rating adults).

The movie version is a very different story from the book but Jim Carey plays Count Olaf by the book.

You will enjoy this book and like me probably collect the entire series. I got all 13 on a Sale at USD 2 each at a local bookstore chain. All hardcover printed in Italy it is a bargain of a lifetime I pulled off.

The wonderful Baudelaire kids with the pretty inventor Violet and the thoughtful all reading Klaus and the cutest baby in literature - Sunny, make for wonderful light reading and I bought these 13 books yesterday and am already into book 2.

Buy the first one and give it a try. Unless you are one of those parents who thinks their kids will become Devil worshippers through something as lame as Harry Potter or are overprotective enough of your kids to bar them from going to a regular school, preferring home education under lock and key - unless you are that type of person - your kids will surely enjoy it very much.

An inspiring story. Better than Dicken's orphans but not as thrilling as Mark Twain's orphans."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

These books read in a doleful, deadpan, Poe-like tone, while discussing terrible events...events that become so terrible that they cross the line to silliness. You have an old-style melodrama villian in Count Olaf. In the three heroes, you have the distilled goodness, courage, resource and sweetness of every hero of every melodramatic childrens book ever written. In Mr. Poe you have the quintessential essence of those eternal, frustrating characters who always refuse to believe children because they ARE children. Every character and situation in the book is a stereotype, overblown and caricatured to the point where you are forced to giggle at it.  Sunny's 'conversation', the author's autobiographical notes, and the sometimes hilarious definitions of words add to the spice. For good measure, the three children are honestly likeable!  Very well written, both stylistically, and for 'grab' value. A series to be read and reread and snickered over many times!  But NOT, for heaven's sake, to be taken seriously.

Right at the beginning, we know that this book isn't going to be full of happy events. It's stated very clearly. Also there are clever use of words. Some if the are subtle jokes which some readers may not pick up on right away. I also that throughout the book many words are given definitions. If i were a teacher and my class was reading this book i would pull out the words that are defined in this book and use them as vocabulary. Another thing i though was fun about this book is that the youngest Baulelaire, Sunny (who is an infant) says things. Most of what she says aren't real words but these non-sense words are given a meaning which make the book fun to read. In addition, this book is an easy read. For anyone looking for something to have fun with, to read to their child, to have their child read this is one of those books. I hope that the next one is just as fun and just as clever as this one has been.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews

They always make me go back to when every story was different, every thing was new, and I wanted to be like all those heroic characters that peopled those wonderful tales. Lemony Snicket's ""Series of unfortunate events"" was released as an instant classic, and I always wanted to find out why. Now, after reading the first book in the series, I know.

First of all, there are no impossible feats attributed to the three young Beaudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny. They are as common and down-to-earth as I was when I was their age. There are also no magic tricks, no nice fairies and no advanced technology to help them in their unfortunate lives after their parents die in a fire that consumed their mansion. Not that tales with magic, fairies, goblins and ultra-modern stuff aren't great - we have Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, just to name the most known examples, and they are also great - but this time the author chose to show to his young readers that even the most simple characters can have great adventures.

Written in a simple but eloquent manner - where the narrator talks directly to you, like a teacher -, with a sarcastic and a little dark vein, ""A bad beginning"" shows the radical change in the lives of the Beaudelaire orphans as they have to live with the despicable Count Olaf, a man whose sole interest is to grab the orphans' fortune, and will conceive the most mirabolant plans to achieve his objective.

The story is very simple, and the book is very short, but I think that as an introduction to a series of more than ten books, it is perfect. Perfect to grab the interest of its readers - not only the young ones, but also the older ones (myself included) -, perfect to make every reader wonder if there will not be really a single happy ending to the Beaudelaires.

I'm hooked, and I expect the series will get better with each new story.

Bradley|Absolutely Enjoyable - which here means entertaining in a light-hearted way.|7-Jan-19|"I just finished off the Netflix series with my 20 year old daughter, and I thought I would see how the book compared to the series.

I wish I had discovered this book ten years ago so that I could have given it to my daughters when it was more age appropriate.  The story zips along quickly enough to keep the reader entertained. It is also very humorous in its presentation of characters and situations. The writing is amusing and well-done.  However, I think the best thing about the book might be the way that it introduces the young reader to a larger vocabulary through the narrator's quirk of telling us what a word ""here means.""

As an adult, I have to say that while this book is really very short - it took me no more than an hour or two to polish it off - it has the trait of a lot of good children's entertainment that the writer pitches jokes on several levels so that on one level an adult might catch the humor of a sentence that would sail over the heads of a child."|5.0 out of 5 stars||

All of them have three very different talents. Violet, the eldest, has a knack for inventing things, even out of useless junk. Klaus, the middle child, is an avid researcher and is very intelligent. And let's not forget Sunny, the baby, who has four teeth as sharp as a shark's and fancies biting hard things. All of them are inventing, researching and biting things up until the day the Baudelaire mansion is distroyed by a terrible fire, along with their dear parents. So, they are sent to live with a distant relative...Count Olaf. He's a short-tempered, demanding, smelly man with a pig-sty of a house. The only good thing to be said towards Olaf is that he spends most of his time up in the Tower, leaving the children lumpy gray oatmeal to eat before doing hard, laborous chores. They discover that Count Olaf is after their parent's large fortune, which Violet is to recieve when she comes of age, and nothing more. His awful tasks include cooking dinner for his theater troupe, chopping wood and doing everything else that pops into his head. Okay, I enjoyed this story immensely! Lemony Snicket's humorous narrating is quite pleasing. Count Olaf is a perfect madman, and the three orphans are quite intelligent with pleasent facial features. If you have a dubious attitude towards ""Happily Ever After"", this might just be your writing style. Unbeliveably more enjoyable and funny than Harry Potter.

What would you be thinking if you were told that awful sentence while strolling around a beach? Shocked? Confused? Unbelieving? That's exactly how the Baudelaire children became the Baudelaire orphans. Violet, a very skilled inventor, Klaus, a reader, and Sunny, an infant, go through a very bad beginning that leads to a Series of Unfortunate Events. When placed in the care of an actor named Olaf, they realize first impressions are important. When one gives small children a long list of chores to do with no equipment or tools, provides one lumpy, small, uncomfortable bed for three people, then demands them to make dinner for ten people in a short amount of time, you realize how awful this man was. But it gets worse. And worse. And worse. Lemony Snicket's best book by far, for children 10 and up.

R. Bird|The terrible, no good, very bad beginning (it's a delight)|7-Mar-04|"People lacking a sense of humor, a sense of irony, and a sense of the whimsical do not get these books.  People lacking an understanding of the intelligence of children do not like these books.  And people lacking the comprehension that sometimes a story is good simply because it turns classical conventions on their head do not understand these books.  ""The Series of Unfortunate Events"", ever popular and entirely urbane, began here in 1999 with the simple story.  ""The Bad Beginning"".  They have been making cool millions ever since.
Elegantly bound and rendered beautiful by artist Brett Helquist's adept illustrations, the books tap into that sense of macabre that lurks at the heart of every girl and boy.  Picking up the book, the reader is instantly told not to read the thing.  Says its back, ""It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing"".  It's the old reverse psychology ruse.  Tell the children not to read the story and they'll come screaming at you for more.  The story itself is simple.  The three newly orphaned Baudelaire siblings have been sent to their nearest relative to live; one nasty Count Olaf.  Prepared to do whatever it takes to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune (a fortune the children themselves cannot inherit until the eldest, Violet, is of age) the Count makes the children's lives miserable, even as he schemes to get their moolah.  Don't think, however, that the children are entirely helpless.  Using their cunning and special skills the kids are more than adequate adversaries to Count Olaf and it is due to their brains that they are able to fight another day.
The book uses a lot of classic motifs to appeal to its young readership.  Often the narrator will address the reader directly, either imploring them to go do something cheerier or defining unfamiliar terms for them.  Author Daniel Handler (pen name Lemony Snicket) is an adept writer.  Though the Count is threatening and dislikable, his violence is mostly implied rather than overt (with some definite exceptions).  Kids are safe reading this series and, though they do encounter corpses once in a while, nothing too terrible ever befalls the children.
The mystery behind the series has yet to be revealed.  Certainly there are many loose ends to be tied up by the end of these books (there will be, the ever apt, 13 in all).  How did the children's parents die?  Who is Lemony Snicket, the omniscient narrator?  All will be revealed in time.  Meanwhile, look forward to the upcoming movie with Jim Carrey as the Count.  No, I do not kid."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

Particularly with the Netflix series out watching that first even got my reluctant reader in the house interested.
Parents be aware that it does feature unfortunate events, as the title clearly states, but this parent feels that the children's never give up attitudes and constructive ways of dealing with their loss(es) is a good lesson which really cannot be conveyed without hardship and that this is a lesson best learned early and carefully when possible. I would prefer my kids understand from a fictional characters example that a good attitude and positive outlets for negative emotions are the best course of action before he/she experiences similar loss themselves so that my kids can better deal with the loss weather I am there to help or in the event that I'm not for whatever reason.
The way Mr. Snicket explains some higher level vocabulary and certain concepts such as dramatic irony(in book 2) is also a plus as is his tongue in cheek humor. He writes on a fifth grade level but, kinda like Spongebob, he puts some tidbits for adult brains in there too that you wont be embarrassed about when you child gets older and figures it out."|5.0 out of 5 stars||

After their parents die in a tragic house fire, Klaus, Violet and Sunny are shipped off to live with their uncle, the evil Count Olaf.  It quickly becomes clear to them that they are not welcome at Olaf’s…especially when they learn of his plot to steal their inheritance!

These books are very fun and should be suitable for most middle-grade readers, although the humor is so smart that I’ve even caught a few of my adult friends reading them as well!  I really enjoyed the way that the children seem to always be smarter than the adults, especially once they’ve learned of Count Olaf’s diabolical plan.

It’s my goal to work through the rest of the series this year, but I couldn’t help thinking about how many children’s book characters are orphans.  I don’t know why that is, except for maybe that writing about orphans could give an author more freedom to explore different situations without worrying about how parents might obstruct the plot of the story?  But what do you think?  Does writing a character’s parents into the story add to the plot, or would it shift the focus off of the kids?"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

If you are reading this review under your own free will, please stop immediately. Alternatively, if you are reading this because someone has threatened to make you eat various flavors of oddly shaped candy if you don't read this, it is even more urgent that you stop. It would be much more pleasant to read a book about horses, or maybe The Littlest Elf.
I will ask you to pay no attention to the five-star rating I must have given this book when I was not thinking. While the thirteen chapters of The Bad Beginning may be printed on nice paper and be grammatically correct, the story it tells of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire is quite unpleasant.
Why, just last evening, I overheard a gentleman, whose name I do not recall, call The Bad Beginning, ""A wonderful book about three orphans and the evil Count Olaf, who schemes to steal the fortune their parents left behind. But the three children stick together through it all and always find a solution to any trouble that Olaf sends their direction."" Even worse than the gentleman whose name I do not recall, was the lady I overheard whose name I recall less who said,  ""The Bad Beginning is a book that people of all ages may enjoy, and takes a refreshing new approach for being funny.""
Please, I beg you, do not make the same mistake that children and adults of all ages have made, who seemed to think that this was one of the best books they ever read, by looking at this book further. I urge you to turn off your computer this instant and get as far away from it as possible.
With all due respect,

The book has a unique writing style. A good chunk of the book is Lemony Snicket telling readers about how his life is as unfortunate as the Baudelaires, or about things you should never ever do in your life.

The book does a good job on portaying how evil a person Count olaf is, and the ending makes it clear that this story is far from over.

Although a realy good series, I'm suprised that its classified as a childeren's book. Later books can be quite violent and at least 1 person dies in most of the books. I guess its classified as ""children"" based on its difficulty, not content.

Violet is fourteen with a real knack for inventing and building strange devices; Klaus is twelve and very well read; and Sunny is a mere infant who likes to bite and to exclaim single words with great depths of meaning. But none of that seems to matter when their house burns down along with their parents while they are enjoying a day at the beach. The law dictates that the three children be raised by their relative, which turns out to the odious--the word ""odious"" here means ""deservedly hateful""--Count Olaf who supplies them with a single bed and cold porridge for breakfast. While the Baudelaire siblings dream of a better life, Olaf saddles them with a multitude of chores and plots to steal their family fortune. From a bad beginning, things just continue to get worse for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.
Young readers of A Series of Unfortunate Events can prosper--the word ""prosper"" here means ""benefit""--from paying attention to the details of the story. There are slight glimmers of hope in the story, although they never last long, and you can anticipate their brief appearances in the narrative if you read carefully. They will also expand their vocabulary because in telling the depressing story of the Baudelaire orphans author Lemony Snicket tends to use unfamiliar words; granted, he explains what they means, just as he translates Sunny's inarticulate outbursts. Young readers might be depressed and despondent-the word ""despondent"" means ""depressed""-when they have finished reading ""The Bad Beginning,"" but they will have learned some new words to help express their despondency.
The only complaint that one (or more) can have about ""The Bad Beginning"" is that it is relatively short. But then, to be fair, there is only so much about disaster lurking around every corner that a young reader can bear. True, the story comes with a strong warning that it lacks a happy ending, beginning or middle, but there is something to be said for discovering that somebody else's lot in live is worse than your own. A gentleman by the name of Brett Haelquist has been hired to provide illustrations that provide a sense of the despair without actually showing you the evil face of Count Olaf or the man with the hook. There is a handsome cover picture and the book is hardbound, as befits a tragedy of this sort. Against all common sense I have a flicker of hope in my chest for the poor Baudelaire orphans as I procede to the second book, ""The Reptile Room,"" but I fear the worst."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews

I knew I had found something special, remarkable, unique, and timeless. Such it was with others: James and the Giant Peach; A Wrinkle in Time; The Earthsea Trilogy; The Hobbit; The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone; and now this.

The back of the book, which warns us to stay away with such perfect, perfunctory humor, and the dedication to Beatrice, ""dearest, darling, dead"", told me immediately, before I had read a single word, that I was about to be delighted again. And the book did not disappoint.

Some have criticized this book, and its many sequels, for its uneven portrayal of grownups. But I think they're missing the point. From the dedication forward (even, or especially by naming the family after Charles Baudelaire), this is pure satire, and with satire, anything is game. So we have clueless grownups, exaggerated villains, and they all serve to demonstrate the ridiculousness of common situations. It just so happens that in the middle of this all, we have a very entertaining little story about a horrible man (Count Olaf - what a glorious villain!) who wants to claim the Baudelaire fortune, and tries to accomplish this by tricking (er, forcing) Violet into marrying him. How they escape this plot is really quite clever, even if it isn't rocket science. But it's not supposed to be.

Friends of mine have found the books entertaining, but have put them down because they were too depressing. I challenge that with vigor. Although the Baudelaire's find themselves in melancholy situations, they always persevere through innovation, dedicated teamwork, tremendous love for each other, and a refusal to accept the ""darkness"" that Count Olaf brings to their lives. There can be no more affirming message than that. I found this book, and all those that followed, uplifting."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

Kraus|A Good Beginning to an Unhappy Story|7-Feb-17|"I believe this book has one of the greatest opening sentences.  The author announces that there will be no happy ending.  And he delivers.  There is no happy ending.

In this novel, the author does a good job of introducing the protagonists:  the Baudelaire orphans.

Violet is the eldest.  She is an inventor.
Klaus is the only boy.  He is a reader.
Sunny is a baby.  She likes to bite things, and people.

The antagonist is the evil Count Olaf.  He is an actor.  And he wants to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune.

The story tells of the Orphans' terrible bad luck.  Their parents have perished, their how has been destroyed by fire, the orphan's have been placed in Count Olaf's care by the incredibly stupid Mr. Poe.

The Baudelaire orphans are the heirs of a fortune.  They cannot access the fortune until Violet comes of age.  This fortune is why Count Olaf is so interested in the children.

There is no happy ending.  However, the orphan's do know how to use their intelligence to evade the Count's evil plot.

For me, the best part of reading this book is the fantastic voice the author uses in the form of the fictional narrator Lemony Snicket.

I plan to read the series in order."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

The children have to do chores every day and cook food for Count Olaf's rude theater troupe, but things only get worse when the Baudelaires realize that Count Olaf is only after the enormous fortune the Baudelaire parents left behind. Klaus, then middle Baudelaire, is the one who figures out that Count Olaf wants to marry Klaus's older sister Violet literally in a play called The Marvelous Marriage in order to gain control of the Baudelaires fortune, and things get even worse when sunnt is hung from the top of a tower in a cage until Violet agrees to marry Count Olaf. You'll have to buy and read the book for yourself to see how the Baudelaires escaped from their miserable situation.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews

Unless you've read the A Series Of Unfortunate Events books, I doubt you can say that. These books chronicle the lives of three smart and clever orphans who must deal with bad, strange situations in each story. And it all starts off with just one fire...
Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire were taking a walk on the beach one day, little knowing that soon, their life would be taking a drastic change. The three Baudelaire children were comfortably growing up in a large mansion. Sunny, the youngest, loved to bite things, Klaus loved to read books, and Violet was one of the best inventors around. On that fateful day, Mr. Poe, a banker and friend of the Baudelaires, approached them and told them that their parents had died in a fire that had destroyed their entire house and had killed their parents. Mr. Poe informed them that they would be staying with a relative named Count Olaf, who lived not too far away. Sunny, Klaus, and Violet immediately know upon arrival at Count Olaf's house that he was no ordinary man. First of all, his house was full of paintings of eyes that seemed to be staring straight back at you. Second, he was an actor and had a whole theater troupe full of strange actors, including a man with hooks for hands, two women that had completely white faces, and other strange characters. Third, Count Olaf's house was filthy and disgusting. Violet, Sunny, and Klaus were given one small room with filthy curtains, a lumpy bed, a cardboard box to use as a closet, a pile of rocks to play with instead of toys, and of course, a painting of an eye. Count Olaf made each child do chores every day, such as making dinner for his troupe or cutting up firewood for no apparent reason in the yard. A couple days after the three children arrive, Count Olaf announces that he will be doing a play in which Violet, Sunny, and Klaus would have parts in. In the play, titled ""The Marvelous Marriage,"" Violet would be the bride, Count Olaf would be the husband, and Sunny and Klaus would be two of the people invited to the wedding ceremony. Justice Strauss, Count Olaf's neighbor, would be the judge. The three children suspected that this play might be part of a plan, so Klaus and Violet borrowed some books about marriage and law from Justice Strauss' library. Klaus finally discovers that Count Olaf's play was all a plan to get the Baudelaire fortune by marrying her using an official document from City Hall, being in front of a judge (Justice Strauss), and having witnesses. Since Count Olaf was Violet's legal guardian, he had permission to allow her to marry, and once a husband had married his wife, all her money would be in Count Olaf's control. Violet, Sunny, and Klaus would have to find a way to stop Count Olaf from ruining their lives forever. The book ends at sort of a cliffhanger; so read the next book ""The Reptile Room"" to find out what's next in the Baudelaire's woeful lives."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews

Book Attict|Spellbinding, terrific, wonderful, etc.|28-Jun-00|"After reading tremendous reviews of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"", I purchased them from Amazon.com. Was I impressed? You bet! From the beginning chapters, when the parents of 14-year-old Violet,  12-year-old Klaus, and the newborn Sunny were killed in a monstrous fire, I  was enthralled. The orphans were taken to live with the horrendous Count  Olaf, who hit them, made them work, and tried to steal their fortune. Among  the aspects that amused me was one of Sunny saying a nonsense word which  the author described as meaning something relevant, such as  ""Gack"" meaning ""Look at that mysterious figure emerging from  the fog."" Some parts truly are sad, and some are morbidly funny.  Unlike some of the reviewers on this website, I have an imagination and I  thoroughly enjoyed this book and its sequels. I am eagerly anticipating the  release of #5: The Austere Academy. Read these books and I guarantee that,  if you have any sort of imagination, you'll love them!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_62?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=62&reviewerType=all_reviews

I promised a young girl I would read it, and although I am in my twenties, I enjoyed it very much. I think it's a great juvenile fiction story and I plan on reading the rest of the series.

If you're looking for a challenging chapter book for your child, I would recommend this. Not just for the creativity, but the vocabulary is advanced, with meanings provided by the author in the text which adds to the character of the narrator.

For those unaware of this series, it is more on the morbid side, but not in a crass way. It's incredibly tasteful, and the sad parts are represented in a way to be more relatable than downright depressing. The narrator feels more like a friend opening a door to the world around you to explain things than just a character telling you a string of events."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

""The Bad Beginning"" is the first book in the ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" book series.  This book is not your average book, and Lemony Snicket is not your average writer. In ""The Bad Beginning,"" the three happy Baudelaire children (Violet, Klaus, and Sunny) become the three sad Baudelaire orphans when they receive the news that they're parents had died in a terrible fire! Now, the children -along with an enormous fortune left behind by their parents, that they will posses once Violet (the eldest) comes of age- must go to live with their 'never heard-of' relative: Count Olaf. But, there's more to the actor and uncle, Count Olaf, than meets the eye. Could it be that Count Olaf simply wants to murder the children to earn their money, since he is their new legal guardian? Or could he just be a very nice man who treats the children really, really, really bad for no reason? A true must-read for all ages, Mr. Snicket is a very clever author who uses the element of suspense very good. If you want to know if the children escape Count Olaf's clutches and what will become of them, then you must read this! Plus, like any other ""I want your money"" story - there's a wedding at the end. But guess who's getting married to who?!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

Lemony Snicket skillfully uses a refreshingly frank and humorous tone to guide readers through the chronic tragedies that these children face.
The recently orphaned Baudelaire siblings find themselves in need of a guardian.  They are placed in the hands of the unknown Count Olaf.  Regrettably, Count Olaf soon makes it clear that he is after the children's immense fortune.  Violet (the inventor), Klaus (the lover of books) and Sunny (the biter) must find a way to safeguard their fortune and keep their lives intact, all while struggling with the loss of their parents.
This first book in A Series of Unfortunate Events encourages a true love of reading as a source of entertainment and solace, but also as a means to provide solutions for sticky situations.  Without painting adults as incompetent, it shows the Baudelaires using their individual talents to problem-solve.
The Bad Beginning is at a good level for fifth and sixth graders.  I would caution that the somewhat grim subject matter of this series might be frightening to some.
However, I would strongly recommend this book to sixth and seventh graders with learning disabilities.  Snicket sprinkles definitions of words and phrases that might be unfamiliar throughout the story in a natural way that does not assume the reader's ignorance.  Short chapters make this book perfect for struggling readers.  Those who have social deficits would also interact well with this book as it points out information that they might not have naturally picked up on.  For example, the fact that toddlers, like Sunny, use their mouths as a way to gather information about the world around them might be new information to this type of reader."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews

Lemony Snicket is a wizard with a pen for a wand; these books are absoletely brilliant! the author has made me laugh out loud and practically rolling on the floor with laughter at his delightfully depressing bouts of such knowledge that is so true it's amazing no one's noticed it before. he talks about things so nonchalantly that the truth behind his words are made hilarious ex: ""if you are alergic to a thing, it is best not to put that thing in your mouth, particularily if that thing is cats"" (wide window 102) i LOVE these books. i can practically recite them from memory. anyone who dopesn't read these books is spiralling closer to the end of their life, and without Lemony snicket, your death will be laughless and depressing. (""if you live each day as though it was your last, eventually you will be right,"" Horse radish, LS)

i think that thsi series isn't scary for youngsters at all. the only thing i would be converned about wuld be comprehension and some of the villans are rather scary... like the hook handed man or the one who looks like niether a man nor a woman... other than that, iv had five year old i've babysat that have cracked up over page one of the bad beginning

The events that befall the hapless Baudelaire trio (Violet, Klaus, and the infant Sunny) are shocking, disturbing, cruel, and very, very unfortunate. So why read, one may ask? Well, for one thing twisted accounts of devious circumstances are always enjoyable when viewed from a distance (ie. the pages of a fictitious book, fictitious meaning ""not real"") and while bad things happen, even worse things are averted through intelligence, cunning, and the urge to teethe. Besides, who could resist such dark fun? It is sad, it is funny, there is an overlying sense of menace throughout but one reads in the hopes that our loveable protagonistic trio will prevail. But will they...? A Series of Unfortunate Events is a great way to get kids who are reluctant to read to do just that, much easier than say leaving such a child bound and gagged in a bird cage dangling thirty some feet above unpleasantly hard ground until they come to their senses! By no means is this series just for kids, ""kids"" meaning the offspring of goats, or perhaps humans? If you like Edward Gorey you'll love this series. Just pray that Lemony Snicket doesn't realize how deranged he is and decides to take medication to alleviate his madness. I, for one, enjoy it!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

Bochynski|Great Read-Aloud!|23-May-01|"I am a 7th grade Language Arts teacher and am always looking for great books to read aloud to my students.  I picked up the first, The Bad Beginning, because I liked the size and cover of the book.  After I read the letter from Lemony Snicket warning the reader to put the book down immediately, I was instantly intrigued.  I was drawn to the author's sense of humor and his unique way to explain vocabulary make me think this was a possibility for a read aloud.
My students LOVED this book.  We are now on the Wide Window and they beg me everyday to read some more.  The kids are beginning to understand the humor.  They boo whenever Count Olaf is in the scene, they groan with the stupidity of Mr. Poe, and they are stunned when Mr. Snicket actually reveals the fate of the characters before it happens.
The best endorsement of a book is when my 13 year old boys, who keep telling me reading is boring, go buy these books on their own!  Well done, Mr. Snicket.  Fremont's 7th grade class cannot get enough of the Bauldelaire Orphans."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews

""The Bad Beginning""

""If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.""  This is the first sentence in the story.  Immediately, I was drawn into the book.  In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. So, how do I convince you that not only will you love this book, but you won't be able to put it down?  Well, here it goes.

The Bad Beginning is about three children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire.  Although these children were intelligent, charming and attractive, they were extremely unlucky and most everything that happened to them was cursed with misfortune, misery and despair.  One day while at the beach, the children received some very bad news.  They were told by Mr. Poe, a friend of the family that their parents had ""perished"" in a terrible fire.  The fire also destroyed their entire house and all of their possessions.

Count Olaf, their guardian, is constantly trying everything in his power to get his hands on the fortune that was left to them by their parents.  No matter how Count Olaf tried to make them feel defeated, they stayed unified and strong.  The message that spoke to me was that even when you are in a difficult situation or under a lot of pressure, you should still stand up for what you believe.

I liked this book a lot because there never was a dull moment.  The Count was obsessed with trying to get their money and he never stopped.  It was like a wild roller coaster ride, full of loops and big drops.  As soon as the children managed to escape one plot, they would find themselves right smack in the middle of yet another.

If you want a book to leave you feeling like you just rode the Goliath at Magic Mountain, this is the book for you.  Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down until the very end.  This book will go with you to brush your teeth, eat breakfast, go to the bathroom and then ride on the bus with you to school, never leaving your hands.  Enjoy the ride!

He is the only writer I have ever read with his strange humor and ability to incorperate vocabulary lessons into a story that fit perfectly; he uses the now famous ""which here means..."" technique. This is his first book in the ""Series of Unfortunate Events"" series, and it may be one of his finest. It tells the misadventures of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire, who become orphans within the first few pages of the books (and whose names are not without a purpose; one who enjoys a little political humor may want to look into them). The story is ridden with carefully represented woe that saves the reader from pitying the orphans and instead has him or her cheering alongside them, which can prove embarassing if the book is being read in a public setting. The adventures are not too outrageous, indeed, the solutions to the problems prove Mr. Snicket to be a clever chap, but if you read book one, you will certainly continue on to book two.

So be forewarned: He has the knack of continuing a story without making it seem cumbersome, but as the books add up, so does the stress and unyeilding desire to buy the next book. If one cannot handle this book, DO NOT continue the series; the trouble gets much, much worse, to say the least. Even I am getting a queasy feeling inside me as I search for an available copy of the Slippery Slope."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews

I kept telling myself I should wait till she was older, but found the book at a good price, so I bought it. I worried it would be too depressing and scary for her, but it did not turn out that way at all.  The book is written from a narrators point of view, so the personal feelings of the characters are never fully exposed and explored.  You know that the three orphans are sad about their parents death, but the book doesn't wallow in their grief and make it painful to read.  If you can imagine Vincent Price reading the book, that tends to make it a little more lighthearted.  The bad guy of the book, Count Olaf, is an awful brute who is outright cruel to the children at times, but again the book doesn't have the children suffering without end.  Instead  it makes them more resilient to foil the Counts plans and triumph over him.  My daughter was EAGER to read these books.  That was the best thing about it all. We have tried classics, Pippi Longstocking, Island of the Blue Dolphins, Charlottes Web, but as great as they are, they lack The Bad Beginnings level of excitement, mystery and wondering what will happen next.  I enjoyed the book myself and will continue to read the rest of the series, in hopes they are as entertaining as this one.  I can see if you have a very sensitive child, this would not be the book for them until they are older.  Some kids my daughters age are scared of Harry Potter movies, so this book would be too much for them.  If your youngster isn't living in a sheltered world where everything is wonderful and bad things don't happen, and they can understand the difference between a made up story and a real one, then they just might enjoy this new type of childrens adventure stories.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_63?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=63&reviewerType=all_reviews

I have read many children's books in which a horrible mess or bad event takes place and through an impossible, over-the-top, unbelievable, sugar-sweet course of events (Holes by Louis Sachar, for example), everything turns out hunky-dorey, right-as-rain, golly-gee-great in the end.  The Bad Beginning turns that sap around 100% and offers an hysterical Series of Unfortunate Events, in which Murphy's Law prevails at every turn.  The characters are delightful, the story-telling is fantastic, and the tone, especially the running vocabulary lessons, is light-hearted and personal.

I was first introduced to this book by a friend of mine. When I read it, I knew that I had to read the rest of the books. I started reading these books in the 5th grade, and next year I will be in High School. So it doesn't matter how old you are. The first book, introduces three children named Violet, an inventor, Klaus, who loves to read, and Sunny, who likes to bite. Their parents are very rich, but they have recently died in a fire. No one knows how it started. So now the three children are taken to their closest relitive. He is an evil and mean man named Count Olaf. Count Olaf is really after the enormous fortune that the parents left to the children. In this book it shows what he tries to do to get his hands on the fortune. But does he? And what unfortunate things happen? In this and other books you will find out. I liked this book because you think well, this book will have a good ending, and Count Olaf will be put in jail. WRONG. These books are a real adventure, and every next book gets better and better. So read all the books to find out about all the evil schemes of Count Olaf, and IF the children will ever get away from him. Plus, don't forget about the movie. It was a real blast!|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews

Marcus. And the song “Scream and Run Away preformed by the Gothic Archies. This is also a review of the hardback book .

Initial listening of this book brought horror and disgust (which in this case means repugnance.) Determined to finish the story despite the author’s constant warnings, I must say that I became enamored of his style.

There are several pluses to listening to the recording. The pace of the recording helps keep you going when you would have set the book aside. The absence of the books illustrations by Bret Helquist allowed you to imagine a more sinister Count Olaf and a cuter, yet with a tad of tomboy, Violet. Now the significant plus is the unmistakable voice of Tim Curry of “Rocky Horror Picture Show” and “Oscar” (1991 as Dr. Poole) fame. His interpretation of the voices gave just as much panache to the characters as Lemony’s writing.

Not in the book, but as additions to the recording are two significant items that help with the understanding of the story, where it came from and where it is going. First is an interview with the author. It covers many of the standard questions asked in an interview; the answers and the communication style is some what unique and a little over the top. Also there is a recording of a song that Mr. Snicket says is played by the Baudelaire memorial orchestra; I have since found that it was realy preformed by the Gothic Archies, written by Gay and Loud.

I do not want to give away the plot however I can tell you that at one point they are forced to eat “boiled chicken, boiled, potatoes and ‘blanched’- here means ‘boiled’- string beans”"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews

I came to this book after already watching the tie-in movie ""Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"". I was fairly certain I would like the novel, as I had enjoyed the movie well enough and I knew that the books were supposed to contain a lot of dark humor, but I was surprised at how very much I loved ""The Bad Beginning"".

This novel is slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all, it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However, the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in the wake of their parents' deaths. The children are wonderfully characterized, and it is such a breath of fresh air to have Violet as an active female character who invents things and scales towers; and brother Klaus is a delightful support character as the brainy bookworm who digs through libraries for answers to help the children out of peril. And, of course, Sunny the biter adds a great deal to the story with her loosely translated shrieks and baby gurgles.

A note about the audiobook edition of this book: this installation in the series is narrated by Tim Curry. He narrates the story superbly and adds a wonderful layer of creepy inflection over the entire affair. The pacing is excellent and the overall effect on the reader is very immersive and well worth the listen.

From the warning in the first few lines of The Bad Beginning, I was hooked.  Even the author's name - Lemony Snicket is intriguing.  The main characters are the three orphaned Baudelaire children.  What could be more gripping than reading about the tragedy that creates their situation and the constant struggle they endure against the vile Count Olaf, who, being their only distant relative, has custody of them now?  There isn't a caring bone in his body!  He even dangles the baby, Sunny out a window, in a cage, to force Claus and Violet to do what he wants.  Why?  He is after their huge inheritance.

Lemony Snicket is a great author and I even got to meet him in person because of my love for this book and the series. ""The Bad Beginning"" is an adventure and a mystery novel about the Beadelaire children and their hardships after the death of their parents. The children are sent to live with a distant relative by the name of Count Olaf who makes the lives of the children miserable. The three Beadelaire children will have access to an extremely large fortune that was left by their parents when the eldest child Violet, turns 18 years old. Count Olaf has one true mission, and that's to steal the Beadelaires fortune for himself and dispose of the three children. Throughout the story the children attempt to thwart Count Olaf's evil plans to steal their fortune and remove themselves from Count Olaf's care. The vocabulary used in this book helps the story flow and makes following the story much easier. The hardships that the Beadelaires come across throughout the story is very interesting and made it very hard to put the book down. Count Olaf is the most interesting antagonist that I have seen in a story. The way his character is constructed makes the problems that the children come across much more incredible. The methods that the children use to stifle Count Olaf's plan are surprising and very intelligent which make the story very enjoyable. The three children all have different skill sets which help them solve conflicts. The youngest Beadelaire, Sunny is an infant who's skill is biting things when needed, as interesting as it sounds. The middle child Klaus is a boy who loves reading and solving problems through books. The oldest child Violet is very good at inventing things out of common household items. Combining them all together creates an unstoppable team of children who can invent, read, and bite their way out of almost any problem. I would definitely recommend this book for people of all ages, who are looking for a good adventure story. This is my favorite series of all time and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_82?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=82&reviewerType=all_reviews

The style, the pacing, the cliff-hanger chapter endings...all contribute to the fun we're having.  When the action gets intense, I shut the book and ask questions.  What should Violet do next?  What would you do?  We even talk about the law, and how people should have a will drawn up.  We talk about how brave the children are.  But we also talk about how today they could call 911, and how they should not feel helpless.  The aside definitions sometimes spur discussion, with my 8 year old saying that he knows what that particular word means.  But often he doesn't know the word.  Anyway, the series is working for me and mine, and it's great to read out loud.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews

Daniel|Wonderful, Excting, Miserable (Not Really) Book.|6-Feb-02|"Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire are three very unlucky children. When their parents perished in a fire, they thought life couldn't get any worse. They were wrong. When the three children are sent to live with a distant relative, they had hoped their luck was about to change for the better. Unfortunately, they had reckoned without Count Olaf and his diabolically fiendish scheme to steal the children's inheritance.
The Series of Unfortunate Events are books that are very different to the typical image of children's literature. As the narrator says, ""There is no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and there are very few happy things in the middle."" The author uses a dark, dry sense of humor and depending on how you focus upon the book, it can either be depressing or very funny. I personally found it very good, but from reading it I can understand why some parents say it gives their kids nightmares. Some of the things that happen to the three orphans are just plain awful.
The characters are both entertaining and interesting, it keeped my intrest and enthusiasm throughout the whole book. Count Olaf is repulsively evil - and the Baudelaires are intelligent, resourceful children who enjoying inventing and reading. No matter what happens, they will always find some solution to their problems, even though more bad things are just around the corner.
I recommend this to all kids over the age of 9. Some people call it a JK Rowling wannabe but I disagree. This series is nothing like Harry Potter, nor it as good, but then what children's book could be? I'll definitely be buying more in this wonderfully miserable series."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

But on a more serious note, and not copying the books (which could also double as a dictionary!) It is a great story of three clever orphans who see misery and woe at every turn. To make matters worse, they are sent to live with Count Olaf, who is the main source of their pain. He overworks them, all the while plotting to steal the massive fortune they will someday inherit. In a daring atempt at the Baudelaire fourune, Olaf makes up a plan so evil that no one believes the orphans when they try to get help. Curious? Read this book, The Bad Beginning, by Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler). It is an exciting book and fun to read, as the Baudelaires find out that in the midst of their suffering, they still have each other.
Personally, I thought the book was very enjoyable. It was a story that, to me, said that even when adults sometimes don't believe kids or think  they can do anything, sometimes kids are the ones who know better (sometimes). I would highly recommend this book."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews

I had never even heard of it. But I opened it up and started reading. As I was introduced to the children of the story, and I just felt instantly sad for them. Here we have three children, that lost their parents to a house fire, and they now have to live with some distance relative that they either haven't seen or never met before. Then the relative tries to marry Violet so he could get their fortune. That is like insult to injury.

What I liked - I really like how the author sets up book one with a beginning that shows exactly how bad things might get with these children throughout the next books. I also really liked that the children were able to outsmart the Count even though he got away from the police and everyone in the end. Though I found it a little predictable in the end, I was surprised to see that she outsmart Count Olaf and his theater friends in the end. I look forward to reading the other books in the series.

What I didn't like - I didn't really like that the author would have sections of the story filled with  sentences like ""the word here means (insert definition here)"" but I understand this is a Middle Grade book and some of those words might be above the children's vocabulary level. It just kind of took me out of the story that's all. I eventually got used to it popping up in the story but in the very beginning it was pulling me out from the story.

Overall - I enjoyed this story more than I thought I would. It has captured my curiosity and I look forward to reading the other books in the series. I would recommend these books to my friends (and their children who are at this reading level)."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

I would say that as Rowling did with ""Harry Potter"", Snicket will captivate people of all ages. A word of warning though, the author clearly states that this is an unhappy story and that if you do not like this you should not try to read it. He is not joking! The story is sad and every time there is a glimpse of hope, it is quickly quenched.
The three Baudelaire siblings are the main characters in this unhappy story. Violet is a fourteen-year-old who loves to think constantly about possible inventions. Klaus is twelve, intelligent and enjoys reading all kinds of books. Sunny is the little infant that is going through a biting stage and will go at anything with her four teeth. Everything starts out wrong right from the beginning, when the Baudelaire siblings, now orphans, find out that their parents died in a fire. They have a huge fortune, but they will not have access to it until Violet reaches adulthood. In the meantime, Mr. Poe, the executioner of the estate will manage the funds and take care of finding a place for the orphans to live in.
Violet, Klaus and Sunny end up living with Count Olaf, in a house that is a disaster and has a weird feeling about it. Also, they quickly realize that the Count's only interest is in the money they have and in nothing else. The kids are forced to take care of the house chores and only find solace in their friendly neighbor, Justice Strauss. But any glimpse at happiness is quickly extinguished by new terrible events. We even get a second warning by the author halfway through the book: ""...people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children should put this book down immediately"". However, my recommendation is: keep reading, you will not be disappointed.
The start of the series left me hooked and I will read the following books in the near future. I like the story, even with its sad tone, and enjoy the author's style. He has a humorous way of writing, defining obvious words and explaining some things that do not need explanations, even for kids. I think this is his way of satirizing some children's book that treat kids as if they were unable to comprehend simple matters. Moreover, there is a point in which he will start defining words using other words he defined before.
I am extremely satisfied with the experience of trying out this new author and would highly recommend it to people of all ages."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Baudelaire children are Violet, the oldest, who makes funny inventions,  Klaus, the middle aged boy, who looks at bugs in a pool of water, and Sunny, the youngest, who bites and chews on things.
 The book is very depresing and that why it is funny to read.  The book is about the three children ovecome the death of their parents.  They also have to deal with the wrath of Count Olaf, who is the closest relative.  The three children were sent to live with him.  Count Olaf is a nasty guy with a run down house.  Count Olaf is mean to the children.  For example, he only gives them cold lumpy oatmeal for breakfast.  The children are in for a ride of their life.

Right from the start, they have all kinds of bad luck, from losing their house in a fire, which would seem terrible to an adult, to getting ugly, itchy clothing, which would seem terrible to a kid.

First and foremost, it was a refreshingly quick and easy read. Some people may not like that but I enjoyed it as I had just finished a book which had given me more trouble than I was used to.

The Bad Beginning is a short book, but the story is enjoyable and interesting. It is clearly ""a series of unfortunate events"" and the author references that this is not the kind of book with a happy ending, or that is full of happiness. Yet, even with event after event, we come to like the children and their cleverness and resourcefulness while we come to dislike the ebad figures such as Count Olaf.

This is because not very many things happened in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children, and they were charming, and resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were extremely unlucky, and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. This book is about the three kids who find out that their parents are killed in a fire. They are left with nothing but there parents' fortune. Count Olaf claims he's their distant relative and takes them as his own. He treats them horrible and the children come to find out that he's only out for their money. The children find out what he's all about, and try to stop him, but everything seemed impossible. In the end he doesn't get their fortune but escaped from the police and the children become orphans again looking for another home. This is a fantastic fiction book to read.

 This was an interesting book to read. It made you wonder what was going to happen. It also explained the big words if you were clueless to what they mean, which was awesome. I definitely recommend this book because they're good and mysterious. They make you want to read it more and more. I believe kids that are interested in mystery books of the ages 9 and up would like this book. It's definitely a page turner because every second your wondering what's going to happen next. The authors style of writing was awesome because not only was it easy but when he used big words he actually told you what it meant in that specific type of situation. This book had many surprises, one was when Count Olaf stole the youngest and put her in a cage to hang from his tower until he had gotten what he'd wanted. Almost every ending of each chapter had cliff hangers. An example of one was when they left you wondering if Count Olaf's evil plan was going to work out for him. I think kids of all ages would love this book I know many of my friends older and younger enjoy this book and the whole entire series."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews

Violet, Klaus and Sunny quickly became the Baudelaire orphans after a tragic fire kills their parents. They are sent to live with a distant relative, Count Olaf. Little do they know, what he's REALLY trying to do is to get his hands on the Baudelaire Fortune, which Violet, the oldest, is willed to recieve when she comes of age(18). This book is filled with naive adults, an idiot genius and itchy clothing. STOP. If you can't handle the itchy clothing part, back away as far as POSSIBLE. Hey, I warned you.

Knowlege is embraced by the noble, and even in the direst situations, there is always the mind to find a solution.

This is a wonderful series, with a very dark beginning.  In the Bad Beginning, Count Olaf is certainly the creepiest and cruelest.  Later on in the series he is portrayed as goofy as well as evil.  The humor is distinct, funny, and melancholy all at once.

Lemony Snicket's narration throughout the story makes me laugh and cry at the same time...but I take stuff way too seriously.  If you are fond of Charles Dickens, Roald Dahl...heck, even Tim Burton, you will find that misery loves company, and you'll love it right back."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

Mind you, the reader can tell he loves telling it, and enjoys spreading the bad news. This is one reader that Snicket has hooked.
Meet the Baudelaire orphans (Violet, Klaus and Sunny) they are the children who have a bad beginning. They find out that their parents have died, and then are forced to live with their strange, scary, and greedy Count that wants all of their money. When the children are with him, they have to do all sorts of work, and sleep in terrible conditions. Hence, it's a bad beginning....and it doesn't get much better. The Count wants to steal all their money. I won't say anything more about the plot, because I dont' want to ruin it.
Snicket has a wonderful sence of humor. It comes through in his unique style of writing that keeps the reader glued to the page. The characters are ones that the reader cares about and wants to know more about them.
 All of the kids in the class I student taught in begged me to read it. I was glad I did. this is a wonderful read. When the kids complained abbout something, I said that they should be glad that they aren't the  Baudelaire orphans.

You should try reading ""The Bad Beginning"".  The Bauldelaire children have bad luck by the fifth page, and it only goes downhill from there.  It's not all bad though, some parts are very clever and bring you hope for the children.  Lemony Snicket does a great job of bringing you into the story and making you feel like you are one of the children.  When they are happy, you are happy.  When they are sad, you are sad.

They become completely addicted, and we ended up reading the entire series throughout the course of the year.  Not only is the series fast-paced and written to be a ""cliff-hanger"", from a teacher's standpoint, it is an excellent way to introduce new vocabulary in a painless manner.  The books also provide an excellent source of discussion about character traits, and literary ""tricks"", like the way L. Snicket uses descriptive words as place names.  All in all, I would highly recommend this book, as well as the others in the series."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Bad Beginning

by. Lemony Snicket

Rating: ***** (5 stars)
Book Length: 188 pages
Genre: Children, Children's Chapter, Middle School

It has been a while since I last read this book and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed returning to its pages. The most unique, intriguing, and frustrating aspect of the book is that the main character of the story could be argued to be the narrator. Everything is told through the voice of Lemony Snicket, which is actually the narrator and not the author's actual name. The style is not a typical style for most children's books and it is pulled off with success.

The writing style is amazing. You are pulled into the story, engage with all the characters, and before you know you have finished the tale. I almost went and immediately bought the next book. The only thing that stopped me was the huge pile of books I currently have to finish. It truly is no wonder that this series has obtained such success.

There is one aspect of the writing style that I found quite annoying. The narrator continually defined the words that he and the other characters were using. As the story progressed the other characters also begin defining the words that they were using. It was annoying because I am an adult reader who was well aware of what all these words meant. Yet, while I was quite engaged by the story the book was not written for me. It was written for middle school readers who are still increasing their vocabulary. The first time I encountered Snicket's unique way of defining words in a story I knew what he was doing. While I, as an adult reader, was slightly annoyed I was also kind of awed by his genius. He has this book that he doesn't want to dumb down for his readers, yet he also doesn't want to loose their interest as they encounter words they may not be familiar with. To decrease the frustration of reading by including the definitions into the quirky flow that already existed in the novel is nothing short of genius.

In a world were ""there is nothing to eat in the house"" is too typically just code for ""there is nothing in the house I am in the mood for"" this book could potentially offer a shift of perspective for young readers. The writer knows a lot about rhetorical analysis, so this book series might also be useful for kids to learn about the darker sides of communication, which will face them in different situations for the rest of their lives. The bright side of the story is that no matter how unreal the pain and suffering becomes in the lives of the Baudelaire children, they take care of one another and adamantly refuse to take things out on each other.

This might not be the right story book for your kid, each one is unique and needs individual attention and care. This might be a good book to read along with your child, because many of life's more difficult issues will come into focus while reading it, it could be a chance to talk with your young reader about those issues.

Let me know if this helps anyone. Morgan."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

The kids were talking about it all the time talking about clues and references and the vocabulary. There is a waiting list for each of the 9 books at my school. I decided to read the first one. It is a twisted adventure that as the author puts it is truely a ""series of misfortunate events"". The author writes in a style which draws the reader in by acting as if the books are important documents that the reader has received to keep them safe. His writing also heavily involves literature and historical references which has stimulated my middle school kids to look up Edgar Allen Poe, J.D. Salinger and Richard Gorey. And his use of large words followed up by ""which means. . ."" is absolutely great for learning at this age. The first time I heard the kids saying ""aberrant, which means very very wrong and causing much grief"" or ""idiosyncrasies, which means an unique habit"" I didn't know where they were getting it. Also the writer is a mysterious prop himself. My kids research him on the internet and are constanly trying to find more clues. These books are not just morbid or gothic, they are an interactive experience. If you want a true review of these ""series of unfortunate events"" DON'T ask adults, ask the kids. Better yet, go to goggle and type in Lemony Snicket."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

""oh, these stories are dark""...""oh, there doesn't seem to be a moral..."". Get Over It. If there must be a moral, it is that bad things can happen to good people, that heroes are people who never give up, and villians can be flat out evil (Olaf) or simply lazy (Poe, or any of the other useless adults) - think Voldemort and Cornelius Fudge in HPV - a useful moral if EVER I saw one.
A friend recommended these books to me and I'm halfway through the series. These books are a linguistic treat, a metaphor-rich collection of unfortunate events. If your kids are reading these, you should too, so that you can talk to them about what happens (good advice about any book, really).

Olaf is not their Uncle!|8-Jan-07|"For the last time Count Olaf is not the Baudelaire orphans' uncle. He is just a man who is after their fortune. If you remember from the beginning of the book it states that Olaf is their ""4th cousin 3 times removed or 3rd cousin 4 times removed."" This quote therefore implies that Olaf is in no way related to the Baudelaire orphans. I think the book is great. I got the movie as a Christmas present. I thought the movie was okay, but it needed to be expressed that way in order to get movie goers to want to read the books without spoiling the books. I love the way that Snicket wrote the first book because it implies that you could read all of the books out of order and still comprehend the books. The series is made of 13 different books with a few connections, which are the Baudelaire's, Count Olaf, and the fact that the Children will never have a happy ending.

I believe that Snicket wrote these books in a ""Romeo and Juliet"" format. I n the beginning of Romeo and Juliet the chorus part tells you what happens in the play from beginning to end, and yet to still continue to read it whether you were forced by a teacher or not. Snicket tells us the essentials of the books in the beginning, but how can you enjoy looking a a puzzle with half the pieces missing? You need all of the pieces and need to understand where they go and why they go there. It's like watching the Harry Potter movies; if you haven't read the books you will most likely be  lost somewhat in what is going on. I hope that you have benefited from this review, as much as i benefit reading your reviews which range from the lowest to the highest. I value everyone's opinions even if i do not agree. I like to take others ways of thinking and analyze why they thought that. Please enjoy reading these books, or at least cherish the fact that you got the chance to read them whether or not you enjoyed them.

Thank you for your time,

Loran"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Bad Begining is the first book in The Series of Unfortunate Evnts.
  There arr three Baudelaire children, Violet, Klause, and Sunny, one day they were playing on the beach when a man named Mr. Poe comes to tell them that there parents had died in a house fire. At that moment the chidren thought their lives would never be the same and it wasn't. Mr. Poe took them to their, third cousin four times removed, Count Olaf. He was a tall man with one eyebrow. He had an eye tatoo on his left ankle.
  As the children went on with their live they relized that they did not like Count Olaf as much as they thought they would. He was a rude a crule man with no good heart at all. The Baudelaire orphans had a great fortane after their parent died, witch could not be accessed until Vilot became of age. Count Olaf wanted thier fortune soooo bad he tried anything he could to get it. He devised a plane to get it.
  If you want to find out what his plan was, if he succeeded, and what happened to the orphans read The Bad Begining By Lemony Snicket.
  I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was one of the best books I have ever read."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews

It has original characters, plots, themes, settings, and an overall ambiance that can be found nowhere else. Lemony Snicket, or whatever his name is, has quite an imagination. One thing, out of many, that I love so much about his books are that there are NO happy endings. There is almost NO sympathy for the characters. Hardly anything good every happens to them. The books are so... morbid. And yet the author manages to make them hilarious at the same time. I've laughed every single time someone's died. I have come across ONE other book with the ability to do that to me. The author has, in short, talent. A lot of it.
If you haven't already read these books, you should. You won't regret it."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews

I liked the way its said if you like nice ending stories then you should not keep on reading but if you liked it then that was the kind of books that you would like to read.

This book takes place in different parts of the United States, there is a family named the Baudelaire's the oldest is Violet,Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children, they were charming but also resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were unlucky children, and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. All this misforutune happened on a day at the Briny beach. This book is about there parents dieing in there house because of a fire and so they have to move with there realitives since they have no were to go.

Towards the end of the book there uncle finds out that they have a big fortune and wants Violet to marry him so that he can get his hands on that money. So he tries everything so that they can leave there other realitives and make them go with him. So I cant tell you the rest you will just have to read the book yourself."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews

Not only do these books give children the chance to learn new words in a fun way, they are also classic examples of storytelling. Kids will love to hate Uncle Olaf and enjoy the antics of three smart, respectful children.  Particuarly, I enjoy the fact that Violet is a 14 year old girl who is interested in engineering, while Klaus loves to read. The reversal of typical ""girls love books"" ""boys love science"" roles is valuable for kids to see.  Finally, I know that I've read them and come to parts where I have burst out laughing. The clever humor adds so much to the series"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews

Within the first pages the Baudelaire children learn that their parents have perished in a fire and that they must go and live with a long lost family member named Count Olaf. What the children don't know is that he has a plot to rob the children of the fortune that they were left with from their parents. Throughout this book you will experience great writing and drawings, marvelous characters, and laugh out loud comedy. The comedy in this book was very funny although it is just consists of snippy little sentences. Read this book for an ultimate reading pleasure.

A little about the books.in the beginning of each book it explains what happens to there parent and how this wierd guy wants there money. he will  do anything to gr the fortune. and i mean ANYTHING!! he almost marries the oldest girl.

Heck, I wont even spel czech.

Simply: It's a great book, and the best 'children's book' reading experience I've had since the original J.M. Barre version of Peter Pan.

I don't see it being inappropriate for children of any age.  It's like the old Bugs Bunny cartoons; so much of it is over children's heads and of such high quality that they'll enjoy it when they're old and fat as much as they did when they were tots.  Maybe it gets a little scary in parts, but still appropriate for very young readers (or beddy-bye listeners).

Frankly, though I love the series, Harry Potter doesn't hold a candle to this in terms of just plain literary quality and a good read."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

If that's not enough to ruin someone's life they are sent to live with a terrible man called Count (shudder) Olaf. He makes them do HORRIBLE chores and doesn't care if he hurts them or not. Oh, and one last thing . He will stop at NOTHING to get the Baudelaire fortune. Nice, huh?

He is still learning to read, but loves to follow along with chapter books. While the language is perfectly appropriate for all ages, the tone of the book is dark. It's about three children that have just learned of the passing of their parents and end up in a terrible foster home situation. If your children aren't too sensitive, I'd absolutely recommend this. The author does a great job of incorporating more difficult vocabulary words, yet extremely explaining them in the sentence that follows.

So, altogether I won't be reading this series with my son, I do plan to check out the rest of the books from the library and finish it on my own. The first book was a quick read, the writing is simple yet it moves along quickly, and it ends with a hook to get you excited for the second book."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

You would feel hurt and sad, wouldn't you? This is how Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire felt when they found out that their parents had died while they were at Briny Beach.

  In The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket (his first book in the Series of Unfortunate Events saga) the three Baudelaire children are left homeless after their parents died in a tragic fire that completely destroyed their home. They are sent to live with a distant relative that they have never even heard of. His name is Count Olaf. The parents of the three children wanted them to be raised within the city limits and he was their closest relative geographically.

  When they first arrive, they notice a beautiful house. Next door, there is a run-down, rickety old house that they hope to never enter. What they find out is that the old house is where they are to stay. The owner of the beautiful home (Justice Strauss) said that the children were welcome to use her library of books whenever they want. The children are happy to have such a nice neighbor next door that they think the stay may not be as bad as they had originally thought. But what they come to think is completely wrong. Their guardian, Count Olaf, makes them do chores all day and gives them cold oatmeal for breakfast. They also find out that he is after the enormous fortune that the Baudelaire parents had left behind for their children.

  I don't want to tell any more about the story or I might as well have written the book myself. You'll have to read it for yourself to find out what happens.

  When I first read this book, I was shocked. I was hoping for a happy book. But just like the old saying: ""You can't judge a book by its cover,"" I was completely fooled. It was one of the saddest and most depressing books that I have ever read. After I was finished, I had my mother read it also. When she was done, she vowed to never again pick up one of Lemony Snicket's books. She believes that he is, for lack of a better word, ""insane."" I asked her what else she thought about the book and this is how she replied: ""Anyone that can write like that is crazy!"" I on the other hand, think he is an excellent writer. They may not be as good as the Harry Potter series but they are some of the best books that I have ever read.

  I believe that the storyline is well laid out. The detail is really great. I can see myself standing next to the three children as they are being told about the tragic death of their parents. My favorite character is Klaus Baudelaire. I can see myself within him, the glasses, the vast amounts of knowledge, and a passion for books. I have read books my whole life will continue to do so until I am on my death bed.

  All in all, I thought that it was a good book. But like I said before, ""You can't judge a book its cover."" If you like to read happy books, this is not for you. But if you like change, go right ahead and check it out of your local library"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews

If there are `tweenagers out there who haven't read it yet, oh! what dreadful pleasures await.  Grownups, once they get over the fact that stories, like life, don't always have happy endings, will also find some amusement and mirth.  Snicket well establishes the resilient personalities of his young protagonists here as well as the drolly wickedness of his vile villain.  For wordplay, unflinchingly intelligent prose, and subtle, entirely anti-pedantic morality, nothing compares to this amazing little book and its siblings.  Lemony Snicket, along with J. K. Rowling, Jane Yolen,  Jon Scieszka and others, are changing the literature of youngsters, especially for this age group, and thankfully so.

Franta|Lemony Snicket = Modern Day Grimms Brother|2-Jan-05|"RARE it is these days to find classic literature being born right before our very eyes, but this mysterious author known as Lemony Snicket is one such superb author.

With a name so persnickerdy, the reader is forewarned that the tale inside the books may prove to be too fearful for younguns.

But - that is far from the case - I read this book with my 9 year old son, and it proved to be highly entertaining and very good for his reading skills which are already pretty impressive.

Violet, Klaus and Sunny are 3 chillens born into real bad luck and lots of bad stuff happen to them in the book. Besides the biggie of their parents dying in a mysterious fire, they are forced to live with their terrible uncle, Count Olaf, who is a real terror and he's super mean.

It gets even edgier when the Count demands that 14 year old virgin Violet marry him so that he can get his miserable hands on the Children's fortune...this is a ghastly plot twist that reeks of pedophilia or incest, but then again,

the Brothers Grimm made that an essential ingredient to their story telling formulas.

No - Violet is saved in the end by clever Klaus and the happy ending shows Count being arrested and chased far away.

The enduring lesson here is that the three siblings strongly have learned to help one another and were able to creatively problem-solve when the going got very very rough.

It's a wonderful lesson to prove, that one is never defeated when united with hearts filled with love.

I am energized to continue reading the entire modern literary library of this amazing author, Lemony Snicket.

Or at least, I have bought the first three books and plan on reading together with my 9 year old....it's fun and it's

entertaining and much has been learned by reading this modern tale of plots that entertained people for many, many years.

Read this book and see if it doesn't work for you.

The warnings are just silly fun from the author - - - he warns that the book is unpleasant, but it's a fun book to read - honest!

Good literature in times where American Literature is somewhat sparse to find."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

I mean horrible.|19-Mar-05|"Don't believe a thing Lemony Snicket says - the only way these books of woe will have you crying is if you laugh really, really hard.

Lemony Snicket has a fresh, unique, and hilarious writing style. He speaks very plainly, explaining things along the way with his signature phrase, ""a word which here means"". Always he reminds his readers that they do not have to read these awful books that will only bring nights of wailing and weeping, although he has sworn to record them. Sometimes Snicket is deliciously non-sequitur - ""...you would run much slower if you were dragging something behind you, like a knapsack or a sheriff"". And each book is morbidly dedicated to a so far unknown woman named Beatrice. ""Beatrice - Darling, dearest, dead.""

Although the books are sold as children's books (or perhaps because of it), I would recommend these books to adults who are secure enough in their maturity to read them. Some of the humor might actually be hard for young children to understand unless they are great cynics already.

The basic plot of the story is this: three siblings - Violet, Claus, and Sunny Baudelaire - lose their parents in a fire. They are sent off to live with their ""uncle"", Count Olaf. Olaf is a horrible, detestable man who will do anything, however evil and dishonorable, to get his hands on the fortune that the Baudelaires will inherit as soon as Violet is of age. The Baudelaires find themselves in frustratingly hopeless and distressing situations, mostly because of the (oh, so aggravating!) thickheadedness of the adults around them. So using their special skills, Violet, Claus, and Sunny try and find solutions themselves - by inventing, researching, and biting things, respectively. They wriggle out of immediate danger, but there is never exactly a happy ending - instead, one that is relieved but forebodes more calamity.

The plot seems very repetitive through the fourth book - the Baudelaires live with various guardians and end up in equally desperate situations with Olaf on their tail. But don't be discouraged! By the fifth book, a larger picture begins to show. A whole mystery opens up - the VFD. What caused the fire which in which the Baudelaires' parents perished? Why are do all their guardians have so much in common? I won't give anything away, but the mystery builds through the rest of the books. The reader picks up little clues and tries to piece things together. The final two books have not been written yet, so don't expect a complete answer soon.

There are eleven books, but they are relatively small and quick reads. When you get through them, read The Unauthorized Autobiography. Snicket himself is an obscure sort of character in his books - he hasn't participated in any action yet, but it seems that he may have to soon. The Authobiography gives loads of tantalizing information (or just more questions) about the VFD.

In summary, The Series of Unfortunate Events is a hilarious, well-written action-and-mystery story, and just as suitable for brave adults as for children."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

I used to like Harry Potter a lot I still do BUT the books in the series take so long to come out and I am tired of waiting and hearing that the date has been put farther in the year!!! Anyway I love this author's type of writing, the book has a great plot not one book in the series is boring either!!! It has plenty of plot twists, mysteries, and some intense suspensful parts. It has kind of a twisted humor to it but that is what makes it so great. Stop reading this and go buy this book it is so cool!!!!!

While exploring the children's section of my local Barnes And Noble, searching for a Christmas present for a five-year-old friend of mine, I stumbled upon The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition (essentially the same book with added notes from the esteemed Mr. Snicket in the back). I quickly picked up the book, made my purchases, and headed home, nearly getting run over by an SUV driven by a woman talking on a cell phone AND putting on makeup at the same time.
When I got home, it occured to me that Nicholas' mother was rather protective and it might be a good idea for me to read the book first.
I was enthralled, a word which here means ""distracted from everything else until the book was finished"". =) All joking aside, I would not advise you to give this book to your children unless you know they are intelligent enough to distinguish fantasy from reality. The book features many lessons that it would behoove many young children to learn, such as how to deal with deaths in the family, abuse, as well as a large variety of other topics. I have read many reviews from overprotective parents as well as whiny pre-teen children who bemoan that this series is such a far cry from their sugar-coated ""Fuzzy Bunny Learns To Share""-style books. Yes, this series is not for small children, nor is it for any adult who cannot enjoy a tragic comedy. But I highly reccomend this book to anyone intelligent enough to appreciate it. I am 16, and I cannot wait until I have my own children so that I can sit down and read them these stories..."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

I don't have kids, I'm not overly interested with any child rearing.

I knew about these books years ago, but I felt at the time I'd be too old for them.  I knew about the movie based on them and, again, felt a little too old from what I saw in the trailers.  Netflix made a series about it, got some good reviews, and I got curious.  After finishing the first season (which is all there is as of the writing of this review), I'm actually considering getting a tattoo.  I've read up, and knowing that the author of the books also did the screenplay for the Netflix series....this might not be the most wholly honest review in the world since I haven't read the entire book, but I do have my bit to say after seeing the series based on the same book(s) that had its screenplay written by the same author.

I've read the first chapter and skimmed the rest (which cements that last paragraph), and I am kicking myself for not reading this earlier.  These books were literally published at a time in my life that I would've appreciated them the most.  Here are lessons that I sorely needed at the time, and I know practically every teen needs to know these things: (1) What makes you unique doesn't make you weird, it makes you useful, (2) Adults don't know everything, no matter how much they say they do, (3) Manipulative and abusive personalities should be avoided at all costs, as should their ""flying monkeys,"" so to speak (4) ""Clueless"" adults may just be naive, even willfully so, but they can be very good people at heart and brought back to your  reality with enough perseverance.

These amazing messages are delivered in a melancholy way, but I would argue that many tweens and early teens feel melancholy themselves.  I know I did.  The unfortunate events in this book are so over the top that you can't help tie them to real events in your own life at times.  I've always rolled my eyes at books aimed at this age demographic, yet here I am at almost 30, and chomping at the bit to tear my way through the series.  I'm not going to lie....I'm expecting to learn another life lesson along the way that I somehow skipped over after all these years."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews

I read it in one sitting, and it wasn't at all what I expected. For one thing, these have been sold along side the Harry Potter books and this one, at least, had no magic in it. On the contrary, it was very down-to-earth. The children's solutions to their problems did not seem particularly far-fetched. Although the books are ""dark"" in some ways, they do not teach a helpless outlook. On the contrary, the kids usually solves their problems by either reading books (law books, in this case) or by using their minds to come up with technological solutions. Their plans are frequently thwarted, and they have to start over again, but they don't give up.
The plot is simple: three orphaned kids must deal with a malevolent guardian who's after their money. The fun part is the witty, entertaining prose. My only criticism is that frequent explanations of word meanings get old. As a child, I derived most of my word definitions from context and figured things out quite neatly. This author stops the dialogue to define words, which is cute the first few times and gets a little annoying towards the end. However, this is a children's book, and perhaps children like that sort of thing. At any rate, I will definitely read the second one."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

Sunny, the youngest, about 12 months old, likes to bite things, anything really. Their family is VERY wealthy.

And as the story progresses, thing get worse and the plot unravels.  After this is over you move on to ""The Reptile Room"", which I also recommend.  But, I'll go into that when I review that book.

The story begins with the introduction of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, 3 very intelligant children who know that there's always something.  Something to invent, something to read, and something to bite.  Violet, the oldest, is one of the world's greatest 14-Year-Old inventors.  She can take almost anything and build almost anything with it in almost any circumstance.  Klaus, the middle child, is a 12-Year-Old reader.  Nothing pleases him more then spending an afternoon filling up his head with a book's contents (and he never forgets anything he reads either).  Sunny, age unknown, loves bites things.  Sunny speaks in a series of unintelligible shrieks.  But, these 3 children over go something huge when they find out their parents have died in a fire that's destroyed their entire home.  This makes for a lovely beginning, doesn't it?  Ha ha ha... WRONG!  Gets worse.

Next up, spending time with Mr. Poe (the banker in charge of the Baudelaire orphans affairs) and his family.  There's nothing interesting about this part.  So, we'll skip ahead to Count Olaf.  This son-of-a-***** is so sinister, it makes me angry to read about him.  He makes them do chores that an adult should be doing, he calls them ""Orphans"", his associates are also ******* beyond all reason, and he does so many bad things to them.  This all builds up through a series of unfortunate events to a play at the end, ""The Marvelous Marriage"" by Al Funcoot, in which Count Olaf disguises his real marriage to Violet as a marriage in a play in order to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune.  Of course, she outwits him by signing the marriage documanet with her left hand instead of her right, as the marriage law states.  The law is that the bride must sign the document in her OWN hand.  And Violet's right-handed, so signing it with her left hand saves the children and their fortune.  He escapes and so ends the story.  However... it gets better (but not for the Baudelaire children).

The 2nd is called ""The Reptile Room"".  Pick it up off the shelf if you want to read the next chapter of the series.  I, personally, am reading them 1-By-1 from my library.  I'm up to book # 7.  Read the series, it gets so much better.  A mystery becomes involved, and more people... oh, it's the work of a true genius.  I recommend the entire series.  Read 'em all."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

I decided she was not ready for A Series of Unfortunate Events, although I loved The Bad Beginning and continued through the series on my own. But she had other ideas. After plucking the book from our library and reading a chapter, and then another, and then another, she was as hooked , and even better, unperturbed by the sad circumstances of the Baudelaire orphans. She passed me in Book 11, The Grim Grotto and finished before I did.

Lemony Snicket's love of the written word, playfullness with language and masterful plotting makes each page come alive. Although I liked some books better than others,  all were wickedly entertaining, enlightening and fun. We're already looking forward to rereading the series aloud with my seven year old son.

The brains of the unfortunate Baudelaire children are incredible and the fact that these books show children using the power they have to save themselves and their loved ones is something very important to me. And seeing a girl like Violet, a girl who is so like the other girls of her age, using her incredible talent for science is just marvelous. And these books never once sugar coat anything (unlike the film).

And to those of you who are wanting to read the books after watching the film, the letter never comes. I'm re-reading these books, and I won't spoil them for you. But nothing is black and white except the print on the pages. Nothing is as simple as we'd like to make it out to be. Very few are wholly evil, and very few are wholly good.  Not everyone makes it out alive and unscathed, and you don't always receive closure.

But that is life.

And life will always have a Series of Unfortunate Events."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

The concept works thanks in no small part to the clever writing  style, smooth narrative and strong imagination running throughout the  story. The drawings, while not spectacular, are charming and add very nice  details to the book itself. Other nice touches include the endpapers,  ""Ex Libris"" plate (both by the illustrator), and the smirky  attitude of the narrator (Lemony Snicket).

The three characters are Sunny, Vilot, and Klaus. From the first page of the book, the Baudelaire children are at the beach, when they recive terrible news. They end up at their far relatives manshion . He is really mean and gives the children hard chores, until one day, the uncle changes. That same day, they find out the uncles plan. In the story, everything is very unfortunate for the children. In the end, everything seems okay, but it's really not.

Luciano|Dark and Hysterically Funny|25-Apr-07|"This book begins the story of the three Baudelaire children.  Violet is fourteen, Klaus is twelve, and Sunny is a baby.  The author starts off by telling you that the story will not be a happy one, and he is certainly right.  The children first learn that both of their parents have died in a fire.  From there things get worse.  Their mansion is gone, leaving the children homeless as well as orphans.  Their parents' will stated that they should go to a relative living somewhere in the city, so their lives won't be disrupted too much.  After some searching, the executor of the will finds a relative--Count Olaf, who lives on the other side of the city.

Count Olaf is a mean and scary man, who makes the children do hard work for him all day and only gives a small room with one bed for all of them to live in.  The children are miserable living with him right from the start.  Then things get worse still.  Count Olaf is determined to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune, which Violet will inherit when she turns eighteen.  The children know that when he asks them to perform in a play with him, he is up to something.  Will they be able to figure out what it is in time to stop him from getting all of their money?

I love the tone of this book.  I love how the author keeps talking directly to the reader to point out that he is telling the story.  Instead of being an impersonal voice, he is another character, with a distinctive personality.

The children in this story are incredibly strong.  They have lived through awful situations but they are still able to function and depend on each other, so despite the author's warnings, you never really believe they are in such trouble."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

From the start of any of Lemony Snicket's books, on the back of his books, and throughout the pages, Snicket urges readers to put down the book and for the reader to pick up something happier. Who would have thought that a children's author would successfully convince children to keep reading his books by making his stories everything that kids, stereotypically, don't want to read.
Spread like encyclopedic lice throughout his books are helpful explanations as to what some of the larger words he uses in his story mean. Soon our children will be using words that we aren't even sure as to what the meanings of them are.
All in all Snicket's stories aren't really all the groundbreaking but are a delight to read simply for the author's commentary into the lives of the unfortunate Baudelaire children, and occasionally references to the author's own life.
I strongly recommend these books for anyone who enjoys Roald Dahl's style of writing, both in his children's stories and his more adult short stories. Snicket grabs your attention and squeezes it until a passerby could easily mistaken it for an Italian zucchini.
An instant classic for anyone who enjoys reading about other peoples woes."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews

Patterson|don't read it and it will be unfortunate for you!|10-Jan-05|"I've read several reviews knocking this book. So, here is an opinion from a 5th grade teacher who reads this book to her class every year.

First of all: it is NOT Harry Potter, nor is this novel trying to be. Yes, the books are dark. But, to those who say they are inappropriate for kids, look in the news. Most children don't live a sunny, happy existence. Kids who have tough lives can relate to this novel and it will not do any damage to kids who come from happy homes.

Second of all, I feel the novels are fantastically written for a 4th/5th grade level. Snickett does explain word definitions. This is not dumbing down since the one thing most kids struggle with is reading comprehension. If they can't understand it, you won't enjoy it.

Lastly, this is one of the only books that I read aloud that my class shows any interest in. They laugh at Count Olaf, they gasp when he slaps Klaus. If The Bad Beginning grabs children's interest and causes them to read the whole series, think of how much the kids are reading. The only way to be a better reader is to read!

I would thoroughly recommend this book."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews

The author does a very good job in moving the story quickly along to allow the suspense to begin. Count Olaf is a terrible man, the children learn but he's a relative. He has a vicious, evil plan to inherit the Baudelaire fortune.

Without giving it away, the good and bad people are easy to learn in this story. The characters are colorful like Count Olaf, Judge Strauss, and Mr. Poe. The kids are also well-written to help move the story along.

The book only took me less than an hour to read at the most.

The main argument of these novels are the suffering of child in a society affected by thirsty of power and individualism, which is masterfully described by Gleitzman

""You know how"" against the more descriptive and less confidential described by Lemony Snicket i.e.

""Unless you have been very, very lucky, you have undoubtedly experienced events in your life that have made you cry. So unless you have been very, very lucky, you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit. So it was with the Baudelair orphans""  (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Lemoy Snicket, page 57)

The plot of A series of unfortunate events is quite different here the main characters are: Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire due to a domestic accident they have lost their parents the beginning of their unhuman suffering summarised in the first paragraph and in particular Violet,  the future heir of a considerable sum of money.

For Klaus reading is a fundamental step for the developing of the society if you read carefully you will be able to resolve any kind of difficulties and problems and even the reader is involved:

""There are many, many types of books in the world, which makes good sense, because there are many, many types of people, and everybody wants to read something different. For instance, people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children put this book down immediately"" (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Lemoy Snicket, page 83)

Philosophically speaking I think that there is a battle between the innocent world represented by Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire and the adult world inhabited by Mr. Poe and his dirty house (like his soul), Count Olaf (the devil) the winner will be described at the end."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

THE BAD BEGINNING is the first of a series of books entitled ""A Series of Unfortunate Events.""  The author, Lemony Snicket (whose real name is Daniel Handler) warns the reader several times: on the back cover of the book, in the opening section of the book, and several times throughout the book; that the book is ""extremely unpleasant"" and if you like nice, fluffy, happy stories that you should put the book down and read something else.

THE BAD BEGINNING briefly explains how the three Baudelaire children-Violet, Klaus, and Sunny-became orphans, how the first met their evil relative Count Olaf, Count Olaf's first scheme at stealing their money, and how they moved from one series of unfortunate events to another.

THE BAD BEGINNING is not the typical ""children's book."" In fact, if a child hasn't been exposed to much classical literature, fairy tales, or life experiences, they probably shouldn't be reading the book at all because it might frighten them by exposing them to all the nastiness in the world.  However, if a child has read any classical literature or fairy tales (where there is all kinds of violence and bad things going on) or has had a lot of life experiences (my grandfather died when I was in the 3rd grade) then they might actually enjoy reading THE BAD BEGINNING.

Mr. Snicket has a delightful time with language and a child's vocabulary is sure to increase after having read THE BAD BEGINNING. They also might learn a thing or two (though they might not be able to understand what they learn) about law and justice.  They are sure to find themselves saddened by the unfortunate state of the Baudelaire siblings, yet somewhat uplifted by knowing that as troublesome as their lives might be, the Baudelaire orphans have it much worse.

Still, children probably shouldn't be reading THE BAD BEGINNING at all. It's a book that youth in their teens and young adults would probably enjoy and benefit from reading the most. Unfortunately people that age are often ashamed of reading and fear of their lives becoming unfortunate by reading such a book like THE BAD BEGINNING will probably prevent them from learning the lessons found therein. Such a shame. I hope the Baudelaire children find happiness sometime.

Sincerely,

Uncle TV"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

They're funny and interesting.  One of the great things about these books is that they aren't funny in the ways that most books are, if you were just looking for humor in normal places, these books wouldn't be half as good.  However, if you read carefully, you will see how humorous they really are.  Also, things that would be mildly sad in other books are some of the things that make these books good.  Otherwise sad things can even be funny.  As a Harry Potter obsesive, I think that these books aren't quite as good as Harry Potter, but they're close.  They are good books to read while waiting for future Harry Potter books.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews

I really liked this book  because it made me want to read in a british accent as I imagined their names sounding very British to me like Klaus, Sunny, Violet and Count Olaf.  As I read, I was waiting for the next bad thing to happen as I could visualize every page in my mind because his words were very animated.  For example, I liked how perfect I could see Sunny in my head while reading the part when Sunny was dangling from the basket.  I could really see that in my head because of the descriptive words.  I felt like I was there watching.  Lastly, I enjoyed this book because two smart kids and a baby could always figure a way out of danger.

And for a elementary children, this is a wonderful book.  The read is relatively quick so they aren't overwhelmed by the thickness and it is still a fun story with characters that you feel terribly bad for.

The prose is perfect for children.  It is easy to read and filled with alliteration.  Best of all, this book goes out of its way to teach vocabulary to children.  Instead of filling the book with long words (for children) expecting the children to look up the words they didn't understand (which they won't), it goes out of its way to explain the bigger words.

This is the story of the Baudelaire siblings and begins right after the death of their parents.  Orphaned, the children are placed into the care of a distant relative named Count Olaf.  It doesn't take long for the children to realize that Count Olaf does not care for the children but only in the fortune that Violet, the eldest of the three children, is set to inherit.  Soon, a scheme is hatched by Count Olaf to take control of the fortune and the only thing that can help the Baudelaire orphans is their wit, wisdom, and bravery.

You are warned at the beginning of the book, and throughout, that this book does not have a happy ending.  It is part right.  The book does not have the best ending, but it doesn't have the worst ending either.  I'll pick up the other books, but it does appear that this book will not leave you hanging and wishing for a different ending.  Actually, I prefer this ending which shows that not everything will go your way which is the norm in life and not the exception.  I don't think elementary school aged children are too young to start learning this, if they haven't already.

If you have young children (grades 2-6) I would highly recommend you encourage them to read this series.  This would be a good step into getting them to like reading.  Harry Potter, while it is a fantastic read, should be left to those who are slightly older and/or better readers than who this book is targetted towards."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

Now I forgot. This IS a children's book, right? I happen to be a fourteen years old, and I recieved this book for Christmas (from a book magazine that sold ""great"" books). Any person I met who read it liked the books (even my english teacher NOTE: TEACHER).
I am an avid reader, reading many of the classics (Grapes of Wrath; Hobbit; The Jungle; To Kill a Mockingbird), and enjoy the fantasy genre. So don't get me wrong by thinking I liked the book because they dumbed it down, or I'm a know-nothing (I happen to be in a special english, and math class).
I found this book to be inventive, with a new style of writing. He kept you interested with the constant mystery, and clueless adults who frusterate you until you have to laugh at them. He keeps you attentive and not bored with a change of writing every few chapters. For example, he with will have little definitions that will obviously not be real, but attached to the storyline, and little humerous tidbits like five pages of ""never""'s, or a couple of pages of black. It's a refreshing edition to the many styles of writing that are used way too often, and changed the direction of ""oh, the hero has trouble, he goes and meets the bad guy, and defeats him. Happily Ever After!"" There is no ""Happily Ever After"" here, and I find that in itself funny.
If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen! This was a fabulous book, and I recomend them all to anybody! I gave the book what it deserved, and if you don't like it. TOUGH! If you have nothing good to say, say nothing at all. Don't try to get people to avoid a book based on your opinion! They should avoid it on their opinion!

The series is almost like a cliff-hanger movie, with the characters facing an impossible and unpleasant predicament which they resolve only to find themselves faced with an uncertain future.
A Bad Beginning introduces the readers to the central characters, the three Baudelaire orphans Violet, Klaus and Sunny.  They are utterly charming and seem designed against stereotype.  Violet, unlike the stereotype for girls, is mathematically and mechanically inclined; she's the inventor of the three.  Klaus, unlike the stereotype for boys, is a great reader; he can learn anything from books and becomes a problem solver.  Sunny, well she's just Sunny, an adorable infant given to bitting things.
While the author goes to great lengths to inform the reader that the orphans have a hard time of it, the actual tale is not particularly upsetting or threatening.  Like Harry Potter, the Baudelaire children have lost their parents and are raised by family that is not necessarily pleasant.  In the latter case this is the mysterious, threatening, greedy Count Olaf.  While the book makes an effort to point out that not all of life goes smoothly, that it really is sometimes a series of unfortunate events, it emphasizes that these are problems to be solved, things from which we learn.  It also teaches that resources are available for problem solving, things like books, reliable adults, even siblings.
Also like the Potter series, The Series of Unfortunate Events exhibits enough plot structure, complex vocabulary, and sophisticated wit to appeal to adults as well as children.
One of the things I particularly like about the book is that the author provides a number of words and idiomatic expressions the meanings of which are explained partially by context and partially by outright definition.  He neither avoids using advanced vocabulary nor assumes that the reader will always figure out the words alone.  He acts as a teacher/parent who helps the learning process along.
A vary charming book.  I look forward to reading some of the others."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

Lemony Snicket knows how to write. The first thing we noticed was the humorous way Lemony builds your vocabulary -- a word here which means ""understanding the meaning of words"". The story flows at a good pace not boring readers for a moment. The characters are colorful and well defined. The books isn't long and the writing is good for readers of 4th grade (and possibly 3rd grade) and up. While the story is truly unfortunate, it's very humorous. Thus, children shouldn't find it frightening or worrisome. The situation the children find themselves in shouldn't concern kids as it is just so outrageous. There are good plot twists and a moral lesson to be learned. It's just a darn good book."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

I first read these when I was maybe 10 or 11. And let me be the first to say, I ADORE THIS BOOK! The writing style is humorous, the characters (particularly the Baudelaires) are well-written and the heroes of the story are excellent role models (epecially Violet and Klaus, who show the benefits of being interested in literature and science, and also demonstrate that there is always hope, even when it seems like the world is against you).

However, I have one small warning: the plot is geared toward older children and has some rather dark themes (parental loss, abuse, marrying an underage girl). This book may be more suited for older children, or even some adults who like YA books. I, personally, didn't really get into them until last year when I could better grasp the concepts and ideas expressed in this novel. However, I recommended this series to my eight-year-old stepsister (a lover of Tim Burton films and the like), and she seems to cherish this book as much as I do. So, maybe, just don't give them to sensitive children or people who don't enjoy darker material? You be the judge of what you/your child can handle.

Overall, however, A Series Of Unfortunate Events is a wonderful book series and I would recommend them to anyone wh cann handle them."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

If so, there is nothing more to see here.

If you failed to heed the wise words of Lemony Snicket, then you’ve finished reading The Bad Beginning and are likely weeping or howling uncontrollably at the injustice of a villain such as Count Olaf escaping. I would advise you not to read further to avoid a summation, a word here which means reliving the horrible tale you were warned not to read once already, but if you didn’t heed Mr. Snicket’s warning, how likely are you to heed mine? After all, how unfair is it that three bright and kind children such as the Baudelaires should lose their parents in a terrible fire? How awful is it that they are forced to wear terrible clothing? Or adopted by a terrible man who is only interested in the fortune their parents left behind and willing to do anything to gain it?

I would like to tell you read The Bad Beginning because the Baudelaire children are kind, smart and likeable but those same qualities are what make it so difficult to recommend this book. In the end, the only recommendation I can give is this: read at your own risk...and stop while you’re ahead because it only gets worse for the Baudelaires from here."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

At the beggining they say it's not a happy ending. Characters klaus,sunny,
Violet,mr.poe, justice Strauss. My question is why do they have nice nice names but bad things happen to them? I like lemony snicket because he shows not tells. I would give this book a five star because of good dialogue, action and inner thinking. Count olaf is a bad person and he is evil.

While Iwas searching, one of the thngs they said they were excited about coming out was the seventh book in the ""Unfortunate Events"" series.After just finishing the first I can see why. I desperately want to start the second, to see what unlucky fate next befalls the three Baudelaire siblings, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. Three very unlucky children whose parents die tragically and are forced to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf. Imagine Harry Potter never getting the chance to escape from the Dursley's and you'll get the general idea. The author relates their tale of woe with hilarity, including a technique of providing definitions for words that the reader might not be familiar with. Destined to become cult classics and handsomely designed and illustrated in their little hardback form, they're books you're kids/niece/nephew/little sibling will want all of. And you'll be sneaking them away to see what all the fuss is about."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

Giovanni|Clever Children Only!|20-Oct-00|"This Series is nothing short of brilliant.  However, not for every child.  Clever kids, smart children, quiet 'outsider' types and those who like to defie thier parents should definitely read this one.  It's one of the few books that is better for boys than for gilrs!  Average kids and simple adults just won't get it.
  What we have here is Gothic for children (I refer to ""Gothic revival"" as outlined by Richard Davenport-Hines in his book ""Gothic- -Four hundred years of excess, horror, evil, and ruin"") The literary merit of these books is beyond question.  There are hundreds of linguistic jokes (""to snick"" means to wound; Mr Poe works for ""Mulcturary Money Management"" --- go head, look up 'mulct')  The author includes himself as a charater.  In each book we find out a little more about what happened to him and his Beatrice (""Dearest, darling, dead."")
As for the concern about the 'incest' mentioned in the review below, I understand this to be a lack of knowlage concerning classic lit. - the evil uncle coniving to marry his pretty niece is stock story line from Plautus, the Mid-evil stage, all the way to Molaire and 19th C. melodrama.
Finally, the books are handsome to hold a wonderfully illustrated- -making them fun to own.
Make no mistake; horrible, awful and very sad things happen to the Baudelaire children but that is all the more reason they are perfect heroes for the 10-14 year old set."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews

It was one of the first books I was reading while I was maturing as a reader.

The book shows that life isn't always fair, but also that perseverance and never giving up is important and things may work out in the end. Things won't happen if you don't take the initiative. It also depicts that there are people with good and bad intentions within the world. There is a potential within us to do good or bad, the decision is left up to us and we must live with whatever happens, the consequences. The author's style revolves around the use of formal language as well as explaining words and phrases that adds to understanding and the mood of the story. Figurative language such as similes, metaphors, and clichés are also exercised in the book.

The book is aimed at a young audience. I would highly recommend this gem of a novel."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews

I'm hooked!|10-Nov-04|I wish some of the lower-star reviewers would stop analyzing this series so much and stop complaining about the violence and how bad all the adults in the story are. First of all, in some books written for children, many times some of the adult characters are written as either really stupid or else very mean or evil. The Harry Potter books are a prime example.  Both the Harry Potter series and the Lemony Snickett series are tales of good versus evil. Oftentimes there is an exaggeration of the bad characters. It just makes for a more interesting story.  I found The Bad Beginning to be fascinating and captivating from the first chapter. I can't wait to read the next book and all the ones after that. I'm hooked on the series and will be seeing the movie for sure.  I'm glad this is yet another series of books that will lure in kids of all ages, and like the Harry Potter books, will instill  young readers with an interest in reading.I liked how the Lemony Snicket books are short and very fast-paced. There was not a boring moment in the book. Wish i could say the same for Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, which i found tedious as hell to read.  I read  the whole first Lemony book in under a few hours and i liked the author's literary style and his technique of explaining the meaning of some of the vocabulary words as the story goes along. This alone, will increase a young-person's vocabulary. Though they may not use those particular words in everyday conversation, when they see them again in print sometime in the future, they will know the meanings. I think this series of books will be as popular as Harry Potter, and in some ways even more so. Highly recommended. As for the  violence in the book, some of it may be a bit scary for very young children under 9, but any child who has watched today's tv shows won't be bothered by what happens in the story. If anything, it just heightens the events and makes it all more fascinating and fun. And anyway, if you're bothered with your kids reading this series, there IS a warning from Lemony Snicket himself that this story is not happy at all and doesn't have a happy ending.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

Hern|Dry wit, dark humor.|8-Dec-00|"If you like dry wit, wordplay, and dark humor, this is your book.  The basic plot is not terribly original: Orphans forced to live with a mean relative who is only interested in their money.  It's the way this story is told that sets it apart.
  Several reviewers claim that there is nothing positive in this book.  Not true.  These children are very smart, and they use their intelligence to overcome (sort of) the obstacles they face.  There is a lot of emphasis here on education and reading.  There is also a lot of emphasis on family.  The children clearly care about each other, and go to great lengths to protect each other.
  At one point, the evil guardian does slap one of the children.  And the guardian's nasty friends do make comments about the oldest girl's looks.  Contrary to some comments in other reviews, these incidents are not handled in a graphic way.
  If your child is (or you are) hyper-sensitive, or very easily frightened, this may not be the best book for either of you.  If your child is (or you are) intelligent and imaginative, you'll have a great time with this book."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews

Olympian High School

The Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny. All are young, smart and good children. They live in a HUGE mansion and are really rich with anything they can ask for. So...everything is going to be perfect and happy in the future right? WRONG! Everything suddenly takes a U-turn, in a direction the Baudelaire's would never expect. Their mansion burns down, along with their loving parents. So Violet, Klaus and Sunny face a new adventure, an adventure of unpleasant hardships, with moving around to new ""parents"", encountering Count Olaf and his henchmen, and trying to stay alive with the rumours about the Baudelaires.

  This serie was the first series I have ever started. This series influenced me because it showed me perserverance. It showed me to never give up when the going gets tough. This series also let me have a habit of reading and curiosity. Having to always wonder what's going to happen in the book. Before I read this series, I thought it was going to be another boring and long story. But I was wrong. After I was done with the first three books...I couldn't stop. Learning new words, having a great imagination and having a love for reading. This series tells me all people have to perservere, because if you quit, you'll be lost in this crowded world of temtation. I also learned that we should not also worry about our self, but to worry about those that care for you. Help them in their time of need, as they did to you. And I learned that reading is fun. The style of this book is Adventurous and Humourous. I recommend this series to all. Have FUN! -Celestine Perez"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews

For the book I review, Lemony Snicket's Seies of Unfortunate Events"": 'The Bad Begining' is neither funny or happy or lucky.  This is a case account of the Baudelaire children:  Violet the ingenious inventer.  Klaus the scholarly reader.  And Sunny the baby who likes to bite things.  The account tells of the tragic demise of their parents who died in a fire which burned down their home.  And that's just chapter one.  Follow them as they try to escape the clutches of Count Olaf who wants their fortune left by their parents.  He will take this at any risk or cost.  A strange comic assassin with a tattoo on his ankle in the shape of an eye.  Count Olaf is truly a hateful person and should not have been put in charge of these orphans.

This volume of the series deals with mysterious fires, loss of life, secrets about a strange symbol, a deadly money hungry guardian, italian dinner, a misguided Judge, and a grappling hook.

Snicket has dedicated himself to tell the true story of the Baudelaire children.  But of course you have the option to never read this book which some people have called ""mysterious"", ""enthralling"" and a ""outright lie""."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews

A. Solinas|Why is this book so charming?|29-Jul-00|"Okay, I thought that a book about bad things that happen to a few young children couldn't possibly be good. It couldn't possibly be interesting. And it DEFINITELY wouldn't be enjoyable.
Boy am I an idiot.
The  Baudelaire children are a trio of orphans who lose their parents early in  the book, and end up being shifted to the miserly accomodations of their  Uncle Olaf, a thoroughly despicable character who comes after Saruman and  the White Witch for hateability. He wants their money, which they are not  allowed to have yet, and treats them horribly.
The characters, except the  Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, have very little character  development but somehow end up being fully believable and playing on your  emotions precisely how the writer intended. The writing style is nothing to  write home about, yet manages to be witty and descriptive--I could  practically see the events being talked about, and the characters as  well.
In a word, this book has the quality of being a wondrous story  without overdoing the detail and things like that.
Does it have a happy  ending? You can find the answer at the very first page. This is a dark  story, dark but excellent. If your children want a happily-ever-after  story, I would advise not having them read this--it will only depress them.  But if your children are not disturbed by a more realistic story, then they  will love this."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

Wagner|Book Review by Derek R.|6-Apr-09|"Do you think your life is bad?  If you do, you haven't even begun to feel what it's like to have a miserable and unfortunate events in life like the Baudelaires are having.  In Lemony Snicket's first book, The Bad Beginning, the adventure begins.  This is a fantastic book!
 The Baudelaires were once a family with no worries until a day when the Baudelaire children were at the beach and a mysterious fire destroyed their house and killed their parents.  They were assigned to other people that were close to their parents, but one person, the very first one, was a treacherous man.  His name was Count Olaf.  He figure out that the Baudelaire fortune was open and he tried to steal it.  As many times as he has tried to steal the fortune, the Baudelaire children always end up finding a way to stop him from stealing it.  Also, Count Olaf has a troupe that follows him around, and they do whatever he says, because if they don't listen to him, they don't get any part of the Baudelaire fortune.
 So read about the Baudelaires and their unfortunate events and encounters with Count Olaf and his troupe as they try to steal the Baudelaire fortune. If you don't you might never know what a miserable and unfortunate event life is like, and you'll be reminded of this story over and over until you are so miserable that you begin a story just like this one."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

My how time flys when you are hearing about the perils of the Baudelaire children.  I notice traffic doesn't bother me half as much while I am listening to these stories. Somethings in life could be much worse than sitting in bumper to bumper traffic.
My children enjoy the stories so much that they don't just want to listen in the car anymore.  Every night before they go to bed we listen to about an hour of the tape.
Also, I think my children appreciate me more after they see what a hard life these children have.

It is not for the faint of heart, but my patients are usually a great deal less faint of heart than I am. Ask them and they will tell you so.
Lemony Snicket -- for that is what the author calls himself -- is sneaky. The plot twists, as expected, but unexpectedly. The atmosphere changes suddenly from horror to humor, and just as suddenly back to horror. Best of all, from my possibly pedantic perspective, the author educates his young readers, but without losing their interest by appearing to educate them. For example, words likely to be unfamiliar to preteens are accompanied by hilarious but accurate definitions.
After I wrote this review, I was dismayed to see Lemony Snicket's (real) name on an offensive ""antiwar"" petition (published in the New York Times and paid for by an organization called Not In Our Name). I cannot condone Daniel Handler's political views, but my enthusiasm for Lemony Snicket as a children's author is undiminished.

Rereading a book that you read when you are a child is like visiting a friend that you have not seen in a few years.  When I see my friends from high school that I have not talked to in three of four years, I am excited to see them, but I hope that we will be able to get along like we did in high school now that we have both changed some.  When I picked up this book, I was really excited, but I was also nervous.  What if this book was not as good as I remembered it to be and that great memory that I had was tarnished by rereading the book?

This book lived up to those extremely high expectations that I had from reading the book when I was a child.  Lemony Snicket's writing style is cynical, yet completely hilarious.  He has a subtle humor that is difficult to get used to at first, but I quickly remembered my love for it.  After I had begun reading the book again, I remembered parts of the plot, but I could not wait to read the ending.  I am glad that I reread this book.

I believe that this book would be great for children who want to read their first chapter book.  Although some of the vocabulary is advanced, the author has a great way of introducing new words to children by defining them, but not making the child feel uneducated."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

These books are for smart and different children, they're basically one long starter course in irony. Where Harry Potter readers are lured into a fantasy world that is sadly void of sarcasm, the Baudelaire orphans go through one scene after another that prepares their followers for early hipsterdom. Complicated words? Bring them on. Grotesquely evil villains? Don't mind if I do! These books breathe the spirit of Edward Gorey drawings, Tom Waits songs and Tim Burton movies, all the while maintaining their very own, deliciously dark sense of wonder. If your child can't get excited about Pokémon, asks a few too many inquisitive questions and won't wear those adorable pink outfits, you have a potential Snicket-fan on your hands. Highly recommended, by the way: The genius audio versions read by Tim Curry."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

I am and avid reader and read everything from Sweet Valley to Harry Potter to Animorphs (and everything in the middle). I purchased this book for summer reading, after reading the great reviews here. I was 10 then, the same age as K.Weill's son. The books are not scary, believe me. This book ilustrates some of the most tragic things in the world, yet I was not scared, as it is ilustrated in the funniest way possible. You can't help yourself cracking up in the middle. Anyway, that's my two cents.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_63?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=63&reviewerType=all_reviews

In my opinion, the Bad Beginning is a very good book so you should really read it.  But, it also is not a very happy book, it's sometimes scary.  If you're looking for it, it's written by Lemony Snicket.

One reason I like it is because the characters are pretty interesting.  There's Klaus who likes to read, Violet who likes to invent things, Sunny who likes to bite things, and Count Olaf who is always trying to get at the Baudelaire fortune.  Now do you see why I think the characters are so interesting?  They all have a good action to them.

Another reason it's a good book is because it's full of adventure.  The orphans are always trying to get away from their evil Count Olaf and they also try to get out of Count Olaf's play where Violet has to marry him.

Because of those reasons, this is a 3rd - 5th grade children's book.  Thanks Lemony Snicket, this book earns 4.5 stars!

(Lily L.)

I find the book the Bad Beginning very interesting.  I hope you will be as interested in the book as me soon.

One reason I find this book interesting is because of all the settings.  There are about four very interesting places the orphans visit in this book.  They are Count Olaf's house, Justice Strauss' house, the stage they perform on, and Mr. Poe's house.  Justice Strauss is their rich neighbor that makes the book a TINY bit better.  Count Olaf is a mean and rude guy, and does not look like a human being.  There are many interesting things happening in those places.

Another reason I like this book is because of the bad stuff that happens.  I LOVE books that have bad things happening.  I think you would too because INTERESTING bad stuff happens.  For example, Count Olaf, their relative, wants to live with the Baudelaire children not because he likes them, but because he wants their money.  The children are now orphans because in the first two pages their parents died.  They have a terrible life.

This book is made for people who love books WITHOUT a happy ending.  II think this is an awesome book, you should try reading it, enjoy!"|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

I don't find the stories depressing, and though you do pity the Baudelaires, it's fun to side with them and find out what mess they'll next be presented with. I also think they make you examine and feel better about your own life, because no matter how awful your life may seem at times, it cannot be as bad as the life of a Baudelaire sibling!|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_62?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=62&reviewerType=all_reviews

Afterwards she was hooked. She usually enjoys books such as ""Judy Moody"", ""Charlotte's Web"", Fairy of the Realm, Harry Potter, and anything by Roald Dahl.  Yes it's true this story is about orphans whose lives are full of misery and despair so probably too creepy for kids under 9. My daughter enjoyed the humor, the suspense, the kids' intelligence and self reliance. She said some parts were a little scary but overall were mostly just suspenseful.

This book is truly the work of a highly intelligent and highly comical individual.  Far from being evil or dangerous for kids, the book is inventive engaging, and happens to be a real page turner.  The characters are far from flat and invoke sympathy or disgust.  The children are loveable, especially Sunny, the biting baby.  Sprinkled throughout the book are opportunities for children to not only witness an interesting story, but also opportunities to add new words to their vocabularies.  Add to this the fact that the book s are not overly dense and long and you have the receipe for the perfect children's book.  Important: This book can also be emjoyed immensely by adults.|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews

It was the first book of the series, A Series of Unfortunate Events. I thought it was a very interesting book to read.

  The book is about three Baudelaire children and their hardships after their parents' tragic death. Violet is the oldest of the children and she's very good at coming up with new inventions that will help them save the day. Klaus is the middle child of them three and loves to go to libraries and read books. He is also very smart. Sunny is the youngest and is the baby out of the children. Sunny loves to bite anything with her shard little teeth. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny start out having a wonderfull, happy, and rich life,until their parents die in a mysterious fire. Though their parents left them a large fortune, the Baudelaire's can't have a penny of it untill fourteen year old Violet comes of age. This means that the children have to live with a relative for the next four years. The Baudelaire's are packed off to live with Count Olaf. Count Olaf only cares about the Baudelaire's fortune, and his distingusting scheme to get his hands on it will make you very sad. But the Baudelaire children fight back using their unique and individual talents. When the children find out Count Olaf's evil plan, they try everything to stop him before it's too late.

  I really enjoyed reading The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket. It is a very interesting book to read. The events' leading to the climax and the climax was very detailed. I also liked the character's personalities because they were very easy to relate to. One of my favorite characters was Sunny, the baby. I liked how the author included the baby into the conversations and while the characters were talking Sunny would cut in with baby gibberish, I would really recommend this book to anyone. It is very detailed and interesting."|5.0 out of 5 stars|Next page?|https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Beginning-Lemony-Snicket-Hardcover/product-reviews/B009O2RE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews
