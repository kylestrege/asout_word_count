You could start with the fact that this is the first true """"guardian-less"""" book of the series; for the first time, the Baudelaire orphans are truly on their own, and as they navigate a hospital, investigate historical records, and try to evade the notice of Olaf and his compatriots, they can rely on no one but themselves. But what's more interesting about The Hostile Hospital is the way that it begins blurring lines that become so critical to the rest of the series. By the end of the book, the line between heroic actions and villainous ones has become a lot more ambiguous than it once was, as the Baudelaires start to realize that many of their actions are exactly like those taken by Olaf. That's heady stuff for a kid's series, and the fact that that theme only develops more as the series develops is just one of the things that made me love it in the first place. Of course, Hostile Hospital is still just a typically fantastic Snicket book, too, with shocking plot twists, new information, gleefully dark humor, and Snicket's usual delightful wordplay (what other book would spend multiple pages setting up a really dumb pun?). In other words, it's a standout even amongst the other great books in the series, and really sets up the books for the second half of the saga, where boundaries, rules, and answers become far more elusive and far more complicated."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Hospital-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064408663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

They then volunteer at the library where they find that there's files on their parents. Of course they soon find out that Olaf is also trying to get those files.

Judd,a sour joy,24-Jan-02,""If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book. In this book, not only is there no"||||||||||||
  happy ending| there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. This is because not very many happy things|||||||||||
  happened in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters. Violet| Klaus| and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children| and they were|||||||||
  charming and resourceful| and had pleasant facial features| but they were extremely unlucky| and most everything that happened to them|||||||||
  was rife with misfortune| misery and despair. I'm sorry to tell you this| but that's how the story goes.||||||||||
Thus begins Book 1| A Bad Beginning| of Lemony Snicket's immensely popular series of dour children's books| A Series of Unfortunate|||||||||
Events.  Of course| I only know that because I found an excerpt on-line.  The rotten little kids in our town have had every installment in the|||||||||||
series checked out of our library every day for the past year.  But the other day when the K-Mart one-hour photolab took about four hours| I|||||||||||
picked up and read enough of volume 8| The Hostile Hospital| that I more-or-less had to buy it.  So now I see why they're so popular.||||||||||
You'll often see Lemony Snicket compared to Roald Dahl or Edward Gorey because the books have such an edge of dark humor to them.  But||||||||||||
more than anything| they are reminiscent of The Phantom Tollbooth or the works of Lewis Carroll| for the author's great love and witty use of||||||||||
language.  Many of the in-jokes will go over the heads of children| but serve to make the books more appealing to adults--for instance| the||||||||||
children's names : Klaus and Sunny (as in von Bulow).  But the central theme of the book is that it is the children's skills and learning that will||||||||||||
enable them to escape from dire predicaments :||||||||||||
  When you read as many books as Klaus Baudelaire| you are going to learn a great deal of information that might not be useful|||||||||||
  for a long time.  You might read a book that would teach you about the exploration of outer space| even if you do not become|||||||||||
  an astronaut until you are eighty years old.  You might read a book about how to perform tricks on ice skates| and then not be|||||||||||
  forced to perform these tricks for a few weeks.  You might read a book on how to have a successful marriage| when the only|||||||||||
  woman you will ever love has married someone else and then perished one terrible afternoon.  But although Klaus had read books||||||||||||
  on outer-space exploration| ice-skating tricks| and good marriage methods| and not yet found much use for this information|||||||||
  he had learned a great deal of information that was about to become very useful indeed.||||||||||||
It's become commonplace to say that JK Rowling has gotten kids to read again| but the Lemony Snicket books go one step farther and|||||||||||
encourage kids to read| to learn| to expand their vocabularies| to value knowledge and use it to solve problems.|||||||||
Add to this the fact that the books are packaged beautifully--they even feel good in your hands--with excellent illustrations by Brett Helquist||||||||||||
and you've got a series that belongs on every kid's bookshelf.  Although| if the local library's any indicator| they'll never actually be there when||||||||||
you are looking for them.||||||||||||

For the first time in reading this series, I had to close the book for a minute and decide what to do about the """"quivery feeling"""" in my own stomach.  It was so intense that I really didn't know if I wanted to keep reading.  This was around the point where, not to give anything away, the children enter the operating theatre.  I was scared out of my mind for the whole chapter after that.  The book ends in a horridly suspenseful place -- I absolutely can't wait until the next book comes out!

||||||||||||
"I've been reading this series in order since I first gained interest through the tie-in movie """"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"""". I love the series for its superb characterization, lovely writing, quirky plotlines, and deeply dark humor, but it's worth noting that the series so far has been extremely formulaic: Mr. Poe drops the children off with a new guardian, things get progressively worse as Count Olaf shows up and starts causing trouble, and then the children barely thwart a cruel plan before being whisked off by Mr. Poe to do it all over again. This eight book in the series really attempts to mix things up a little bit by not starting out with Mr. Poe, and indeed not showcasing a new guardian at all."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
In some ways| this installment is one of the first where I've been truly frightened for the plucky Baudelaire orphans| and the first one where they seemed genuinely alone and in danger to me. Maybe it's because of the tension of separation for several chapters -- it's impossible not to be on the edge of your seat when the unstoppable trio is forced to split up and one of them is put in very grave danger. And perhaps also it's because this is the first novel where the whole wide world of surrounding adults really seem genuinely hostile towards the poor orphans instead of simply foolish| apathetic| or generally worthless.||||||||
||||||||||||
If you've loved the series so far| you'll love the engaging writing and increased creepiness of this one| but if you're getting tired of the basic plot premise then this book isn't going to be a breath of fresh air.||||||||||
||||||||||||
A note about the audiobook edition of this book: this installment features the superb narration of Tim Curry that the early books in the series featured. Curry does an incredible job with the story and it is impossible to not be drawn into his deep| rich narration as he follows the orphans through their dangerous adventures.|||||||||||

Much attention is given to the postmodern leanings of the series, specifically its heavy use of metafictional techniques and its (relatively subdued) blurring of the lines between fiction and reality, but perhaps my favorite aspect of the series is its commentary on language."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"In the first so many books of the series, many times the narrative will halt in order to define one meaning of a word, and Sunny's language must constantly be translated. But it isn't (as far as I remember) until this book that the surety of these definitions is questioned. Much of the volume will give one definition of a word or phrase and then explicitly state why that definition is not correct using the Baudelaires current situation as an example. (""""No news is good news."""" is an early example of this.) Also, Sunny has, by this volume, learned a number of English and non-English words, and when she uses them they are often defined differently than their normal use. And with the constantly growing number of definitions for """"VFD,"""" it's really hard to ignore themes of the fragile relationship of language to meaning in the series."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"And, wonderfully, the volume presents this fragility in a manner that appears so natural that it is not even a question: sometimes words mean one thing, somethings they mean another, and sometimes they mean nothing at all."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Hospital-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064408663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

R. Bird,The doctors are in,29-Jul-04,""Books with unreliable narrators abound in the world of adult publishing. In the world of children's books they're less common but not necessarily unheard of. Heck, Walter Dean Myers's """"Monster"""" is a good example of that. But how common is the unreliable narrator who tells a story over the course of thirteen books, growing less and less reliable as time goes by? Part of what I like so much about """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" is the fact that our author, Lemony Snicket, is becoming more and more important to the Baudelaire orphans on a personal level. Heck, in """"The Hostile Hospital"""" we even see a photograph of him in the story! But I get ahead of myself..."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
" In this latest adventure, the Baudelaire orphans have, for the first time, found themselves without a guardian. You can decide if that's a good or bad thing for yourself (especially when you consider some of the awful places they've found themselves in the past). For the Baudelaires, they probably view it as a bad thing. After all, they're on the run from the law. Falsely accused of murdering Count Olaf (who is alive and well and currently tracking the kids down yet again) they find themselves taking brief refuge in the Heimlich Hospital. There, they start working in the Library of Records, a huge space filled with file cabinets containing all kinds of information. While there the three discover a file entitled """"Baudelaire"""" containing information that raises some very peculiar ideas about the fire that destroyed their home and (possibly) their parents. But when Violet is captured by Olaf and his troupe of horrible actors, it's up to the two remaining orphans to save their brainy sister."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
" The kids have faced some awful misses in the series before. Yet I think that the horrible fate awaiting Violet in this particular tale is really the worse yet, though. Just a glace at the cover will give you an idea of what faces the pretty fourteen year old. I loved how the mystery of VFD, the Snickets, and Olaf's penchant for fires has started coming to a head. Certainly there are five more Baudelaire stories to be told after this one, but in """"Hostile Hospital"""" you start getting the distinct feeling that Lemony may not be a particularly unbiased author. For genuine edge of your seat thrills, this book is truly exciting. Before my beddy bye I was going to stop reading for the night around page 129 but found that the tale was impossible to put down. I didn't stop reading until 255. I also kept jumping back to my """"Unauthorized Autobiography of Lemony Snicket"""" to try to piece the different clues together that I had found. Very slowly a frightening portrait is emerging. It's delightful."||||||||||||

Although the storyline a great and humor filling I believe this series would not have been as popular without Lemony's few quirks. He is still constantly explaining words (with outrageous definitions), and has the few odd add-on's (this time it was STOP, another 4 pages of black). But by far his most unique move has come now, in this book. If you read you will see that the characters are growing (Klaus had a birthday, Sunny can now speak fairly coherently). He is also pulling himself, as an author, into the story, a move I've never seen done before. This alone should catch people's attention, but the dark humor and exaggeration (on almost everything) makes these books into a classic series.

Several elements make this near-perfect book such a great addition to the series: first| we as readers get the best hints yet as to the ties between the Beaudelaires| the author Lemony Snicket| and the mysterious Beatrice that the author so dearly loves.  While the hints are only a tease of soooooooo much more to come| they keep your adrenaline flowing and your interest peaked as much as any Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys book did when you were a kid - VERY suspenseful!  Secondly| and more remarkably| the orphans have gone from put-upon victims to characters you really care about -- by about book #6 (this is book #8 here)| you have stopped chuckling at all the bad luck dealt to these kids| and really begin rooting for them to come out of their unfortunate events alive and well.  Third| the cliffhanger ending of this book makes you ACHE for #9| which won't be out until July!!  What an ending!!||

Holder,Hair-Raising Hospital Horror,18-Apr-03,""In the eighth book in the series """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""", we not only get to be miserable with the Baudelaire orphans, we also get to be afraid.  """"The Hostile Hospital"""" picks up where """"The Vile Village"""" left off.  The children are walking away from the village of V.F.D., trying to figure out what to do now that they are on the run from the law."||||||||||||
The children come to a general store in the middle of nowhere| which fortunately contains a telegraph.  They try to contact Mr. Poe to tell him they did not commit the crime of which they are accused.  Unfortunately| the children do not hear back from Mr. Poe before the person that delivers the newspaper arrives and shows the store owner a picture of the children in the newspaper.  After a chase throughout the store the children escape from the store into a van containing the most bizarre collection of hospital volunteers that you have ever seen.||||||||||
The children realize they need to do some research to see if they can find more information about their family| and a man who was murdered in the village of V.F.D.  By a strange coincidence| the hospital has a huge records department in the basement containing hundreds of file cabinets of information from all over the county.  By another strange coincidence the children are able to volunteer to work in this facility.||||||||||
As you can imagine| the children have to live somewhere| and they would rather not have to drive back in forth in the van lest someone recognize them.  Further| where would they go anyway?  So the children live in the unfinished half of Heimlich Hospital| using a canvas cover for a blanket and to keep warm.||||||||
The children's search through the records is disturbed by the arrival of| yes| you guessed it| Count Olaf.  This time we see very little of Count Olaf| and instead see another character the reader will know from a previous story (I'm not telling!).  During a chase through the records room one of the Baudelaire orphans is captured| and Count Olaf and his gang of criminals plan to do an operation on the captured orphan that is planned to turn fatal.|||||||
"As we reach the end of the story the Baudelaire orphans escape Count Olaf once again, as much as they ever escape.  However, this time their escape is more precarious than any previous escape, and we are left to wait for """"The Carnivorous Carnival"""" to see how it all turns out."||||||||||||
There is another strong educational message in this book| presented with only a little subtlety.  In order to learn more about their parents the Baudelaire family the children must try to find the information in the records room.  Their search is detailed as they fruitlessly search through file after file.  As always there are the words that are explained by the author.|||||||||||
"This book has managed to top the previous books in this series.  The excitement is much greater and the story is faster paced.  While the ending of the story can be truly frightening for younger audiences, the children do escape.  I recommend this book for at least a 9-year-old child, however, as always, you need to judge the ability of your child to read these books.  I am in the process of reading """"The Carnivorous Carnival"""", and can hardly wait to see how this series of books will end.  Five stars for another excellent entry in this series."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Hospital-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064408663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

 LIke all the other books it all started when a fire had killed their parents. So their parent's fortune was sent to them. They were sent to Mr.Poe who| then sent were sent to a guy named Count Olaf. In this book there is a murder a guy got killed. Then Count Olaf frames it on the three children. The Children ran away they didn't bother telling anyone because they knew no one would believe them. As the police were chasing them in the middle of no where they come across a store called the last chance general store. Because it was really the only store left. So they went in and there were so much stuff. They asked the storeowner if they could send a telegram. The storeowner said yes| and said do you have money they said no it's an emergency so he said ok it's for free. They telegrammed Mr. Poe telling him what had happened. Then a newspaper called the Daily Poncho. The children knew that they were in the front page. So they ran for because they knew they wouldn't believe them. They were saved because a group called the V.F.D came and they went in the van. The V.F.D. is an organization the sings for sick people in the hospital. When the V.F.D notices them Violet says her name is Sally. But the leader of the group says we don't need names we just call it other brother and sister. They go to the hospital and they were looking for volunteers to work in the file room. You're going to have to read the book for the rest.||||||||||

Still| here? OK| don't tell me I did not warn you; here is where we are. At the beginning of the book we find the poor Baudelaires running away from the police. They are wanted for a murder the did not commit. And what is even worse| the supposed victim| Count Olaf| is not even dead! At least the two Quagmire triplets have been able to escape from the evil Count| but they are on an air balloon and cannot communicate with Violet| Klaus and Sunny to explain the secret of VFD.|||||
||||||||||||
Violet| the inventor| Klaus| the erudite reader| and Sunny| the ferocious biter| send a telegram to the useless Mr. Poe to ask for help STOP But before getting a reply they have to run away again and join the Volunteer Fighting Disease. Is this the VFD they are looking for? That is how they end in Heimlich Hospital working in the Library of Records. Here| they come across many picturesque characters. The hospital administrator| Babs| communicates with everyone through speakers. She has the theory that kids should not be heard and adults should not be seen. This is just as snippet of Snicket's genius| which he uses to create novel ideas to work with| and thus| make us laugh throughout his stories.
||||||||||||
As you can imagine| Count Olaf will show up sooner or later| as will the repugnant Esme Squalor. In that regard| this is the book in which we see Lemony Snicket coming closer to the story of the Baudelaires and drop hints left and right as to his involvement in the events that led to the current status quo. For example| he alludes to his interaction with Esme Squalor| several times throughout the story.|||||||
||||||||||||
"This is the darkest story in the series so far, and it is plagued with dangerous situations. Snicket is at the top of his game in using humor to keep us engaged. He keeps regaling us with expressions by Sunny and their appropriate translations making us laugh non-stop. He also is extremely good at applying common sense in dissecting popular sayings, such as """"No news is good news"""". Everyone knows that """"No news is no news""""."||||||||||||

Holder,Hair-Raising Hospital Horror,6-Apr-06,""In the eighth book in the series """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""", we not only get to be miserable with the Baudelaire orphans, we also get to be afraid.  """"The Hostile Hospital"""" picks up where """"The Vile Village"""" left off.  The children are walking away from the village of V.F.D., trying to figure out what to do now that they are on the run from the law."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
The children come to a general store in the middle of nowhere| which fortunately contains a telegraph.  They try to contact Mr. Poe to tell him they did not commit the crime of which they are accused.  Unfortunately| the children do not hear back from Mr. Poe before the person that delivers the newspaper arrives and shows the store owner a picture of the children in the newspaper.  After a chase through the store the children escape from the store into a van containing the most bizarre collection of hospital volunteers that you have ever seen.||||||||||
||||||||||||
The children realize they need to do some research to see if they can find more information about their family| and a man who was murdered in the village of V.F.D.  By a strange coincidence| the hospital has a huge records department in the basement containing hundreds of file cabinets of information from all over the county.  By another strange coincidence the children are able to volunteer to work in this facility.||||||||||
||||||||||||
As you can imagine| the children have to live somewhere| and they would rather not have to drive back and forth in the van lest someone recognize them.  Further| where would they go anyway?  So the children live in the unfinished half of Heimlich Hospital| using a canvas cover for a blanket and to keep warm.||||||||
||||||||||||
The children's search through the records is disturbed by the arrival of| yes| you guessed it| Count Olaf.  This time we see very little of Count Olaf| and instead see another character the reader will know from a previous story (I'm not telling!).  During a chase through the records room one of the Baudelaire orphans is captured| and Count Olaf and his gang of criminals plan to do an operation on the captured orphan that is planned to turn fatal.|||||||
||||||||||||
"As we reach the end of the story the Baudelaire orphans escape Count Olaf once again, as much as they ever escape.  However, this time their escape is more precarious than any previous escape, and we are left to wait for """"The Carnivorous Carnival"""" to see how it all turns out."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
There is another strong educational message in this book| presented with only a little subtlety.  In order to learn more about their parents and the Baudelaire family the children must try to find the information in the records room.  Their author provides the details of the children's search as they fruitlessly look through file after file.  As always the author explains some of the words he uses in the book.|||||||||||
||||||||||||
"This book has managed to top the previous books in this series.  The excitement is much greater and the story is faster paced.  While the ending of the story can be truly frightening for younger audiences, the children do escape.  I recommend this book for at least a 9-year-old child.  However, as always, you need to judge the ability of your child to read these books.  I am in the process of reading """"The Carnivorous Carnival,"""" and can hardly wait to see how this series of books will end.

The Baudelaire Orphans are with the banker Mr. Poe until he can find a new relative willing to care for the siblings. Things go badly and the evil Count Olaf shows up with another nefarious plan to kidnap the children and somehow steal their inheritance. In the end they get away and Olaf is on the run from the authorities. The ending of The Vile Village changes this. The Baudelaires are on the run, suspected of the murder of Count Olaf despite the fact that he isn't dead and that there is no way they could have committed the non-existent crime. The Hostile Hospital opens with the orphans trying to find a place where they can learn about VFD, the Quagmire triplets, and some clue that will help keep them safe and stop Count Olaf from coming after them ever again. This time there is no Mr. Poe and no new distant relative to live with. Count Olaf is in much less of this book than we have come to expect, though he and his cronies play major roles in instigating the action."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
Author Lemony Snicket (an assumed name as the author is as much a character in the story as the Baudelaires are) does an excellent job in presenting the story of the Baudelaires experiences at a hospital trying to research in the records room what the truth behind the events of the past several novels and once more running afoul of the minions of Count Olaf and being placed into mortal danger once again. Snicket sets up the next volume very well and tells the story in such a way that the novel flows into the next book while telling an independent story at the same time. The breaking of the formula of the series is a refreshing change and spices up the action quite a bit. The Hostile Hospital is one of the best of the first eight volumes in this series.||||||||||||

The first few books were separate stories connected only by the first book (The Bad Beginning), whose plot was explained in the first couple pages of the books following it. Now, they no longer make an effort to explain to the reader what happened in the previous story, so it's up to you to do your reading before picking up this book!"",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Hospital-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064408663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||

They are lucky (?) to come across a hospital by way of joining up with a troop of happy-go-luckers who sing ridiculous songs and would rather give sick and dying people a heart shaped balloon than penicillin, call themselves, """"Volunteers Fighting Disease"""". First it was the Village of Fowl Devotees, now we have Volunteers Fighting Disease. More confusion reigns for the Baudelaire's as they try and figure out exactly what the meaning is of coming across multiple VFD's."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
"Once inside the hospital, they are immediately put to work in the Library of Records, which, for an unfathomable and unexplained reason contains the type of information that should be in a real library, not filing cabinets in a hospital. Their job at first seems tedious, because the filing system is, to be kind, a debacle. Information on turtles might be filed under """"T"""" for turtles, or it might be filed under """"S"""" for reptiles with shells on their back, or perhaps """"I"""" for infuriatingly slow creatures. Or, perhaps """"R"""" for reptiles! Is your mind dizzy? Mine is."||||||||||||
||||||||||||
But their work in this library is not for naught. They come across something called The Snicket File| and while the contents have been mostly removed| just enough remains to offer them some unlooked for hope.||||||||||
||||||||||||
Unfortunately - and isn't this a sad descriptor that comes up in most reviews of the Baudelaire's adventures? - tragedy (another sad descriptor) strikes. Violet is captured and is scheduled for a cranioectomy| which really isn't a valid medical procedure. You see| cranio-| in medical terms| refers to the cranium| which is the skull. And -ectomy refers to the removal of an anatomical structure. So a cranioectomy is the removal of a person's skull! This is obviously not a good thing.|||||||
||||||||||||
It is left to Klaus and Sunny to figure out a means by which to save their sister| and the manner in which they attempt do so is| as appropriate for Snicket| hysterical.|||||||||

Pietrisycamollaviadelrechiotemexity is one of the words that the infant Sunny Baudelaire uses to communicate (however, her speech skills are quickly improving)."||||||||||||

In what is the best entry yet in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events| the three Baudelaires find themselves at Heimlich Hospital.  They have been cut off from Mr. Poe| the man charged with placing them in the homes of new guardians| their friends Duncan and Isadora Quagmire are floating in the sky somewhere with Hector from the Village of Fowl Devotees| and they have been framed for the murder of a man everyone thinks to be Count Olaf| but in reality| Olaf is still hot on their trail.  Once again| the Baudelaires have pursued the wrong V.F.D.| this time they join Volunteers Fighting Disease| which is how they end up at the hospital.|||
||||||||||||
However| just when things seem as if they can't get any worse| a ray of light shines through when Violet| Klaus| and Sunny discover something very interesting in the hospital's Library of Records...  However| things go back to their usual unfortunate-ness when Olaf and his associates attempt to perform the world's first cranioectamy on a young girl named Laura V. Bleediotie (think about the name for a second or two)| and things keep going from bad to worse as the story goes on.||||||

"This is definitely the best book yet, but it is partly due to the fact that this is the most unfortunate outing yet for the Baudelaires (if the levels of sadness and unfortune that they encounter can even be quantified).  I can't wait to see what happens to them next at the Carniverouos Carnival..."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Hostile-Hospital-Unfortunate-Events/product-reviews/0064408663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||
