Kraus,Does the End Justify the Means?,3-Apr-17,""The theme of this novel is exploring the nature of good and evil.  Count Olaf and his henchpersons have used evil means to try to capture the Baudelaire's fortune.  The orphans themselves had had to use evil actions in order to escape from the evil Count."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"All along the way, the orphans have met relatively nobel people who have allowed evil to happen to the children.  These people have hung the children out to dry, rather be involved in the children's predicament.  The phrase """"hand the children out to dry"""" means to let the children fend for themselves, and to then forget about them."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
This book begins on a high note.  One of the orphans' allies| a member of the secretive and good VFD treats the orphans nicely and with concern.  But soon the children are thrust into the same old predicament.||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The children are at the the Hotel Denouement.  Soon there will be a gathering of all the VFDs| both good and evil| to either protect or destroy the hotel.|||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The Baudelaires are given jobs that are definitely to dangerous for three young children.  Since no one will be honest with them| the children do things that probably more evil than good.  Due to their actions| there is a fatality.  And once again| good people who should know better| turn their backs on the children.|||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
And you'll never believe who helps the orphans leave the hotel.|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
This was a very dark novel.  It made me reconsider good and evil in the first twelve books of this series.|||||||||||||||||||||||||

The different thing about the series that was an improvement were the 3 chapters that you can read in any order. That was pretty good! Another thing that I liked was the battle between good and evil without identifying which is which. Therefore as the reader you had to define for yourself. Another thing that Snicket does throughout the series was use situations that were so stupid or phrases that were so stupid that it was funny. I couldn't stop myself from misbehaving at the desk at work because I would laugh out loud or be astonished by something outrageous.I really loved the book and by the time I was to the last page I wanted to know the rest of the series.

Familiar faces, some of which they are happy to see, many of which they shudder to think about, show up.  And it all ends in an unthinkable manner."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
After meeting up with Kit Snicket| sister of Jaques and Lemony| at the end of the 11th book| Violet| Klaus| and Sunny Baudelaire are brought to the Hotel Denouement| the last safe meeting place of V.F.D.  Kit explains that they must help her and her friends finally bring Count Olaf| Esme Squalor| and their associates to justice.  Numerous V.F.D. volunteers will be arriving at the Hotel within two days to aid the children.  However| Olaf and many of his followers will also be present in order to finally retrieve the important sugar bowl (Vessel For Disaccharides) once and for all.  Kit tells the children that she will be meeting up with the newly reunited Quagmire triplets who are using the self-sustaining hot air mobile home to arrive at the hotel| and in a few days will return for the Baudelaires.  Meanwhile| they must remain at the hotel and gather information about both sides.||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The children encounter most of their old guardians| including Sir| Charles| Vice Principal Nero| and Hal| as well as Geraldine Julienne| the irresponsible reporter of the Daily Punctilio that has caused a lot of legal trouble for the children.  In the process of their observations| they learn a few details that make the mysteries of their lineage and the history of V.F.D. even more interesting and confusing| especially a revelation about their parents and Count Olaf.|||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"This book definitely felt very different from most others.  Violet didn't do much inventing and Sunny didn't use her cooking or biting skills very often.  Klaus' skills at research were highly valued in this book, especially since the entire hotel was built to model the Dewey Decimal System.  Also, it has a very pronounced """"calm before the storm"""" kind of feel to it.  Lemony Snicket/Daniel Handler is definitely preparing us for the final volume, which will hopefully answer the numerous lingering questions."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Most of the other themes of the series are still very prevalent.  As usual| the Baudelaires seem to be the only competent people in a sea of bizarre adults; in fact| I am beginning to draw parallels to this story and Alice in Wonderland (author Lewis Carroll is often alluded to in these stories).  The dark humor is as good as ever (I loved the reference to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia)| and the constant warnings still please.||||||||||||||||||||||

This is the second to last book in a series of unfortunate events, narrowing down to the final book in this dreadful series. A lot of the characters reappear, some along books 1 right to 11. There are a lot of back stabbing, arguments, accusations, assumptions, a lot of vile villainy(especially by the mean, nasty, horrible, wicked, villanous, bad, ugly, repulsive Count Olaf), and a very horrible death(supposeably by the Baudelaires). The story, is very horrible to explain but I will explain. There are a lot of questions answered, and a whole of knew ones added. It is also good to flick through the pages and find out any clues (i.e Beatrice is the Baudelaires mother). The characters appear all at the right time. There are character from previous books who the Baudelaires are happy to meet, and there are some they have dreaded to meet. The book is an unexplainable masterpeice, which has been holding us still ever since the first book came out seven years ago. The ending is sad and abrupt, and they once again are out at sea with the nasty and hiddeous Count Olaf. We meet new characters, one especially by the name of Dewey Denouement who dies in a sad sad time. One thing I can tell you is it is relenting and astonishing!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

Today| not so long ago| I was bouncing up and down| clutching a fifty dollar note between my sweaty hand. Sweat poured from my brow| and I entered the bookstore down the road to recieve my copy of 'The Penultimate peril'. Luckily| there was two copies left. I read it straight when I got home| and I found it enjoyable. The book is the biggest so far| and the characters are so lovable| everybody has something special. Jerome Squalor| for instance| is a mesmerising character| for his hard effort on caring for the Baudelaires and because he is also an injustice expert. Mr. Poe| for instance| is a gullible pretty ordinary character| not seeing the full story. He is an annoying character. Justice Strauss| for instance is another loyal friend. She is of the high court and tries to provide justice to the unlucky Baudelaire orphans| who are the 'unlucky' characters. Kevin| is an ampidextrous person| who thinks he's a freak| just because he is ampidextrous. There are many other characters| for instance Principal Nero mimmicking all the time| is as hilarious as anything the series has provided. Mr.Remora eating dosens of bananas| Mrs. Bass for her obsession for the Metric System| is just a few of the characteristics. There are many more characteristics of many other characters| which I have not typed down. It would take me all night to list other better characters| so I will leave it at that. The growing personalities are what drags you in in reading these books.
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Lemony Snicket also provides readers a brief moment of happiness| as he writes the most hilarious stuff down. I was laughing on my bed loudly| enjoying every moment. He also defines words or phrases you commonly or don't actually here like in other books. The Baudelaires| as Kit Snicket describes| have grown immeasurably. Sunny's english has improved immensely| and she is now saying stuff in proper english. Klaus is getting smarter and bigger every day| and Violet's knack for inventing stuff is just wonderful for a fifteen year old kid| and she is improving quite considerably as well as Klaus's researching skills. Sunny| of course is a master chef. These characteristics go a long way. There are numerous questions| which I had explained earlier in Paragraph One| one that's faded a bit is 'What is V.F.D?'. The story is perplexing and confusing as the Baudelaires go to the Hotel Denouement to act like flaneurs and find out who is a 'volunteer'| and who is a 'villain'.It is hard to spy and find out anything in a perplexing hotel| with a number of floors| rooms| shops and lobbies. The rooms and floors are organised through the Dewey Decimal system. The Baudelaires encounter a sizzling amount of misfortune| unable to gain trust on people who might be noble| or people who might might as well be evil and villainous.|||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Mr.Snicket provides many many surprises in this doubtly be the most darkest, terrifying tale ever produced by Lemony Snicket ever. The next to last things they encounter in this spiteful tale are, a stunning reflection, a harpoon gun, a perplexing, huge and impressive hotel, a person with smoke for a head, a repulsive vilian, a trial and a kidnapping. Enjoy reading 353 splendid pages in the next sad chapter in the unfortunate lives of the Baudelaires.

But there's something deeply satisfying about the way The Penultimate Peril starts to deliver on the themes the series has been building up to, especially as it comes to blurring the lines between good and evil into non-existence. So many books for children clearly divide the world into good people and bad people, but The Penultimate Peril finds the Baudelaires taking truly horrible actions - some by accident, some intentionally so - while simultaneously forcing us to realize that painting Count Olaf as a villain isn't as cut and dried as we might like it to be. It's rich material for any book, much less a children's series, but to have it done as well and as elegantly as it's done here would almost be enough by itself to make me love this book. But The Penultimate Peril has so much else going for it, from absurd courtroom scenes that take the idea of blind justice too literally to moments of quiet reflection that are wonderfully, perfectly honest in the best ways possible. And even though it's the last book of the series, The Penultimate Peril gives us the last bow of many beloved characters, clearing the stage for the final act to come. There's only one book to go in the series, and since I've read it before and I know what to expect (and what not to expect), re-reading the series has been a chance to savor all the details - not just the literary in-jokes and the sly comments that work better for a 34-year-old dad than his 7-year-old son (how many children's books contain jokes about Antonin Scalia?), but the character development, the wonderful way that author Daniel Handler uses his books to explore grief, the pains of adolescence, and a huge spectrum morally complex questions. And The Penultimate Peril does it all as well as the series ever did, and did it in such a way that's both satisfying on its own terms and sets the stage for the finale to come. No small feat."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

They love the series for its stangeness and its crazy word play, for characters like """"The Man with a Beard but No Hair and The Woman with Hair but No Beard."""" And although I have to say the series started to bog down a bit and seem repetitive around the third and fourth installments, the most recent entries are absolutely enthralling. The Penultimate Peril truly raises the stakes, as Snicket makes it clear (to the adult reader) that he is writing an extended allegory about the struggle between good and evil in the modern world. The 11th installment (The Grim Grotto) had introduced the wonderful expression """"the world is quiet here,"""" as the slogan of secret organization dedicated to the contemplation of ideas, justice and nobility. The Penultimate Peril begins with a quote from Martin Luther King: """"...right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant."""" And it ends with a haunting and prophetic quote from Richard Wright's 1940 masterpiece Native Son about """"the skyscrapers in our cities toppling."""" To the young reader, these heady themes are just another bit of flavoring in a rolicking adventure that is as pleasing to read as it is completely unpredictable. The three Baudelaires work as undercover concierges in the Hotel Denouement, encountering a menagerie of strange characters from all their past adventures. We learn a lot more about the organization known as VFD, and the children discover a few troubling details about their parents' past. It's all just weird and mysterious (and sometimes annoying) enough to keep a young reader on the edge of his or her seat. My kids pick up this book when they wake up at 6:15 in the morning to get ready for school, so that I can read to them before they get on the bus. It's such a joy to hear my youngest laugh out loud at Snicket's wonderful word play on the phrase """"born yesterday,"""" for example, or to watch them squint their eyes in concentration as they listen to a snippet of Lewis Carroll. As a parent, I am now as indebted to Lemony Snicket as I am to J.K. Rowling. They are the twin pillars of The Word in our home."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

This time, they were assigned to Hotel Denouement, where they have to take a 24/7 service as waiters and waitresses. Then, you-know-who comes into the scene - Count Olaf, and his girlfriend, Esme Squalor, who betrayed her husband months ago. The good part is that the Baudelaires find Dewey Denouement, who is considered to be a legend. When Carmelita Spats, a spoiled minion of Count Olaf, attempts to fire a harpoon gun at the Baudelaires; when they tried to defend themselves, they accidentally shoot Dewey, and (obviously) he dies. When matters become worse, the Baudelaires decided that they've done enough wrong things, and joins Count Olaf's side."|||||||||||||||||||||||||

You can tell that this book brings misery because at the beginning of the book, the author states, """"The miserable tale of the Baudelaire orphans will be safe in the pond's murky depths, and you will be happier not to read the grim story I have written, but instead to gaze at the rippling scum that rises to the top of the world."""" The Baudelaires would often end up in trouble, but wherever they go, they're going to feel like it's heaven, as long as Count Olaf isn't around."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"  There are also other reasons why I liked the book. It involves the critical thinking of all three Baudelaires (even Sunny) to save their lives. The Baudelaires must endure everything, like customer complaints, for example, to keep up with their """"job."""" (Just to tell you, most of these complaints come from Sir.) Also, this book tells you the definition of some words you MAY not understand, and often Carmelita's childish temper (She's nothing but a cakesniffer!) There are lots of different traits in this story, sometimes specified (ex. The Baudelaires.)"|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"  My favorite part in this story was when Count Olaf fires Esme Squalor (my least favorite character) and Carmelita Spats. Rather than being henchmen, it is true that they deserve to be fired. At first, I thought that Esme may have returned to the good side, but then she said that she was still evil, even though she dumped Count Olaf. Count Olaf then impatiently fires the harpoon gun at the Baudelaires (even though mainly it was Carmelita) which leads to the dramatic scene."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

Snicket's clever play on words is of particular significance, for he is telling us exactly what he's doing, in the event that thick headed readers don't pick up on it."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"First, the book is entitled """"The Penultimate Peril"""". Penultimate means (I won't try to imitate Snicket's style as I have in other reviews because I'm not sure I'm that clever anymore) """"last but one in a series of things"""". So he's telling us, although most of know this already, that he's only writing one more book."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Second, all of the events occur in the Hotel Denouement. Denouement means """"the final part of a play, film, or narrative in which the strands of the plot are drawn together and matters are explained or resolved."""" In this book, if you pay attention to the characters, how they are interacting, what they are doing, who they're doing it to, much is explained. Who were their real enemies during the last eleven books? Were people like """"Sir"""" who made their lives miserable at the mill (well, maybe that was clever), an ally or an adversary? Again, if you read very carefully, with a discerning eye, you see that perhaps not is all that it seems - and that is something that Snicket does better than anyone writing for this age range. He does a tremendous job of *making us think*, so how could this book possibly not advance anything? It's my personal belief that writers who make their readers think, and do so in a fashion that's not simple nonsense (i.e., setting up a mystery or mysterious events and then explaining them away as a dream) are the best kind of writers. Snicket is one of those, a master of his craft. In that sense, this book is *brilliant*."|||||||||||||||||||||||||

Vaske,""Ahem,"",12-Sep-06,""Dear reader,  Bystander, Civilian, Pedestrian, Alien, and or sea creature I, not related in any way to Mr. Snicket, will write my review for A Series of Unfortunate Events on this one page, for you see I am quite lazy and writing 12 different reviews for the same series would only put you dear readers in harms way of being offended by my grammmar, pronunciation, and spelling(although I highly doubt anybody will even bother to read this, escpecially after my boring introduction).  So as to make things simple I shall say all I have to say right here."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
A Series of Unfortunate Events is a series about| well a group of Unfortunate Children called the Baudilaures. Unfortunate in this case means| for every person that wins the lottery or finds a penny on the street you can bet that the Baudilaures will have just been tricked by some  fellow who tried to steal their inheritence or had their house burn to the ground.  This series has gone up to 12 books and will end with Book 13 cleverly entitled: Ahem| The End.||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
It also has a sick|  villain named Count Olaf who follows the children around and tries to get their inheritence.(STALKER!) Ahem| anyway these children face horrifictatioously danger at every turn| excuse my spelling as it will get worse and worse as I am banking on the fact that no one will read this and this small memento of time and devotion shall be utterly wasted.  But I shall continue to write nontheless for I feel it is my sworn duty to advise you to read this book series and hopefully I shall not get sued by any legal associate of Mr. Snicket for copying his fine prose.||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Overall these books are cleverly written with some wit and humor and suspense.  They of course shall not rank up with the likes of The Hobbit| Lord of the Rings| War of the Worlds| Lord of the Flies| and the Dictionary(an engrossing read) BUT they are great fun to read for any age.|||||||||||||||||||||

My heart often leaps into my throat when the kids are in danger| and I sigh with relief when their ingenuity gets them out of that particular danger.

Are you one of those millions of fans for the Series of Unfortunate Series waiting for the twelfth book of the series of come out? The Penultimate Peril is my all time favorite in the Series of Unfortunate Events. I mean| the book before| the Grim Grotto| really sucked in my opinion so I decided to stop reading the series. But then| with the Penultimate Peril ending in a mystery with the promise of the final book to come| I just can't stop reading Lemony Snicket's series!||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The Penultimate Peril starts with Violet| Klaus| and baby Sunny Baudelaire  arriving at the secret last safe place| the Hotel Denouement| where the VFD will gather for the last time. The three orphans| who had moved from one home to the next| get caught up with their dead parents| who had left an unsolved mystery behind them. Now| the Baudelaire orphans try to figure out the mysterys of the VFD| an organization that their parents had joined| at the Hotel Denouement.|||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Little did the Baudelaires know that their long time enemy, Count Olaf, was waiting for them at the hotel with my evil notions....... and a plan to find the suger bowl, a key to everything in this whole series. Lemony Snicket really hasn't explained what is so important about this suger bowl except that the """"something"""" inside the suger bowl was stolen from Esme, Count Olaf's girlfriend, by Beatrice. Who is Beatrice? Some girlfriend or wife of Lemony Snicket's...."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
With the big task of observing every resident for honesty or evilness in the hotel| Violet| Klaus| and Sunny take on the job as concierges for spying on enemies. As each go their different ways| the orphans meet their old guardians and see familiar faces plus unwelcome faces. I really like how Lemony Snicket has put together a book with characters from previous books. Some authors forget their previous books in a long series| but| luckily Lemony Snicket hasn't forgoten yet.|||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
To add to the mystery of the members of the VFD| Violet| Klaus| and Sunny meet a very important member of the VFD: Dewey Denouement. But| before Dewey could instruct the Baudelaires to the suger bowl..... the Baudelaires meet Count Olaf| their enemy in charge of trying to overthrow the VFD and also for trying to steal their fortunes. Count Olaf accidently makes it seems that the Baudelaires kill Dewey... but he didn't know that the secret of the suger bowl would die with Dewey...||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
In a trial to decide their innocence in the murder of Dewey.... the Baudelaires finda out their judgea are the evil planners of stealing the suger bowl with Olaf. To survive the mob in the Hotel Denouement| Violet| Klaus| and Sunny all use their special talents to help Count Olaf escape to the last safe place.||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Is there another safe place where the VFD can gather? With the fire set aflame on the hotel| the Baudelaires can only hope that the VFD will get their fire message that they have failed to gather.||||||||||||||||||||||||

""""You're volunteers, ready to face the challenges of a desperate and perplexing world."""" Indeed, in this adventure the profoundly unlucky Baudelaire orphans face dilemmas more perplexing and desperate than any they've faced in the previous eleven books in A Series of Unfortunate Events."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Now that they've reached the Hotel Denouement, the hapless siblings must pose as concierges, heavily disguised to protect their identities, and discern the true motives and identities of the hotel's many mysterious guests. Indeed, during their explorations of the massive hotel, the Baudelaires encounter characters from nearly every one of their previous misadventures (including that cakesniffer Carmelita and the always """"in"""" Esme Squalor)."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"The Hotel Denouement is full of secrets, able to be unlocked only by those who really understand the Dewey Decimal System. From the rooftop sunbathing deck to the laundry room, the Baudelaires try to sort out the volunteers from the villains, hoping against hope that they're not """"wrong, wrong, wrong."""""|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Lemony Snicket's twelfth book lacks none of the verbal wit and clever snarkiness that have made this series so popular. Indeed| now that youngest sibling Sunny is speaking more clearly| her dialogue contributes even more to the clever wordplay at which these books excel. Some surprising secrets are in store| as well as a real cliffhanger of an ending| which promises to make the series much more complex than anyone would have imagined.|||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Even though Lemony Snicket would tell you to toss THE PENULTIMATE PERIL into the nearest puddle or pond| it's definitely worth keeping up with the ongoing saga of the world's most trouble-prone siblings. The only unfortunate thing will be the wait for the series's final installment!||||||||||||||||||||||||

This book is the penultimate in the """"Series of Unfortunate Events"""". the beginning starts off with the main characters( Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire) getting in a taxi with Kit Snicket. She is part of a secret organization called V.F.D. The organization would put out fires and do objectives kept to be secret. Then, one day the Great Schism took place, and the organization was split into two. The ones that started fires and the ones that stopped them. Ever since the Baudelaire children lost there parents, there lives have gone miserable. When they were sent to there first guardian, Cont Olaf, they found he was evil and escaped him, but he always came back. Later they found out he was part of the evil part of V.F.D. Ever since, they've been helping out on the good side, hoping to find their """"dead"""" parents. Anyway, when Kit Snicket comes to help the children, she drops them off at this really awkward hotel by the name of Hotel Denouement. They go undercover as concierges to find out more on the secret meeting taking place Thursday. The problem then comes just around the middle of the book. Count Olaf shows up with his minions to ruin everything. After having to make very tough choices, including having to kill a very dear friend, and going through obstacles, the Orphans escaped on a boat. However, Count Olaf went with them!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
  This story really inspired me on how to be brave on decisions. The Baudelaire's have perseverance. Even when their life just gets worse and worse| they still hang in there| and they do every little thing to make the situation better. Nothing discourages them. They'll think of a smart solutions in the middle of it all. This book tells me that all people are divided up into two. The ones who are evil to others in order to hide their fear| and the ones who get picked on| but aren't afraid and will stay there until the end. After I started reading many of Snicket's books| I started being less afraid of things.||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery stories that only gives you little information, and its up to you to figure a lot of it. These series are very wonderful and I would recommend you buy them as soon as possible. The way this book is written is in thirteen chapters, just like the other series books. The book contains 353 pages, and it is a fiction/mystery book. It is the penultimate book of the series."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

Actually, it was one of my least favorite books I had ever read. I prayed to God that the twelth installment wouldn't be a stinker, and thank goodness, it wasn't. Infact, THE PENULTIMATE PERIL is now my number one favorite in Lemony Snicket's thirteen-book series. There was just so much to like about it, but there was one main reason that made me appreciate it over all the others. Every ASOUE book tends to be a little more mature than your average children's book, but this one is a hundred times more intense than each of the others. Like the Baudelaires realize midway through the story, they are no longer children (except for Sunny) proving that the events of their lives are no longer kid stuff. If you thought book six of Harry Potter was intense, wait till you try reading THE PENULTIMATE PERIL..."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Right from the first chapter of this brilliantly-written novel, the Baudelaires know that the things they're about to face are like no other. A fellow V.F.D. member has them disguised as hotel conceirges at Hotel Denouement, where they will pretend to be your average """"hotel helper"""" while secretly being on the look-out for any villains that might try to cause chaos to the upcoming V.F.D. meeting. I thought that making the setting a hotel was a great idea, as one of the most interesting places in the world is a hotel. This led up for some hilarious scenes involving some of ASOUE's best characters, although it also led for some extremely depressing scenes that may fill your eyes with tears. After all, there's a reason why Lemony Snicket warns you not to read this book and pick up something much more delightful."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Another detail about this book I really enjoyed was that so mo many characters from the previous installments in the series showed up. Best of all, none of them were underused or overused. They were placed perfectly in the story so you'll say to yourself """"Wow, I can't believe they're back!"""" It's a huge disappointment when a series author forgets their series' past, but Lemony Snicket / Daniel Handler certainly doesn't. No important character in the series goes unforgotten in this book, and although having tons of characters return would be more fitting for the last book, I'm glad Snicket / Handler did it with this one--after all, he has a lot of plot to get out of the way and unsolved mysteries to answer with book thirteen. This leaves me to the only problem I had. There weren't enough questions answered, but I trust that book thirteen will answer everything, so it's not much of a disappointment."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"If you think A Series of Unfortunate Events is a lame kiddie series that definitely don't show true angst, you better take a look at this one. From beginning to end, THE PENULTIMATE PERIL is filled with more drama than you can even imagine. The ending is the most dramatic the whole book (and it's the most intense ending in the series) and will most likely leave you with your jaw dropping. Many other ASOUE fans and I were amazed at how much has changed from book one to this amazing piece of literature that is book twelve. But I have a warning for you--even if you're anxious to read this book, and you haven't read the rest, you really have to or you'll be completely lost. Although there's quite a few books you're going to have to get through, just keep your hopes up that eventually you'll be reading THE PENULTIMATE PERIL, the best ASOUE book so far, and one of the best children's novels the world has ever seen."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

It's pretty lengthy at 353 pages but it will still not feel long enough."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
After the events of The Grim Grotto| the Baudelaire children are traveling with Kit Snicket| member of VFD. They're headed to the Hotel Denouement known to both factions of the VFD schism as the last safe place for the volunteers to meet safely. But she won't be going with them and will only drop them off as she has other business to attend to. They'll be disguised as concierges of the hotel in order to allow them to move about freely.|||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Their mission is to locate and observe """"J.S."""" and determine if this person is a volunteer or villain. This is complicated by the fact that the hotel is being managed by the identical siblings Frank the volunteer and Ernest the villain, but Kit has no information on how to tell who is who apart from trusting their instincts. And once there, the Baudelaire children encounter many familiar faces from past misadventures who are also at the Hotel Denouement - but the eternal question is which of them are volunteers and which of them are villains?"|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
What I Liked: There's so much about this book that I love and it's pretty much a grand celebration of all that had come before. Beyond the return of different characters| there's also so many clever clues worked into this title as firmly defined by the challenge of figuring out who is Frank and who is Ernest based on brief encounters with one of them as they either provide instructions for the Baudelaire children or test them with questions of their own. There's more puzzling double identities in play here than in your average spy thriller.||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Beyond that the book is also a culmination of the many struggles of the Baudelaire children and all the growing up they've had to do in order to survive everything thus far. In trying to learn more about VFD| they ended up sort of undergoing a very rushed training for VFD. By coming to understand the traits that define what makes a volunteer versus what makes a villain| they were all faced with the choice of who they want to be. And that's quite the amazing journey that was sort of present but was also quite subtle until it was called into action in this book.|||||||||||||||||||||||

What Could Have Been Better: This book can be quite confusing if you don't remember practically all the characters from the past books. A decent understanding of who each of them are will help you better understand who might be good and who might be bad| but that's not necessarily easy across 12 titles thus far.||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
Then after so many starts and stops about who VFD is| this book sort of blitzes through that together with the Grim Grotto and there's no more time and the Baudelaires must make some very hard choices. And it's not easy to deal with all that within a limited number of pages. For every time I complained about things feeling slow on the meta plot front| this book accelerates forward at a crazy rate as if there was no tomorrow. And for the most part| this may be be truth.||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"TL;DR: The Penultimate Peril may be among the best if not the best book in the entire series, which is funny to say about the second-to-the-last title. But there are just so many plates in the air with the Baudelaires struggling to keep up and determine who are volunteers and who are villains and the tension may just drive you a little mad."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

Holder,Perplexing Perils Pursue Plucky Baudelaire Children,12-Jan-07,""This book is the twelfth book in A Series of Unfortunate Events.  This book follows """"The Grim Grotto"""" and precedes """"The End."""""|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"We began in story where """"The Grim Grotto"""" left off.  The Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, on her way out of babyhood, have jumped into a taxi driven by none other than Kit Snicket, who is taking the children to an unknown destination.  The unknown destination turns out to be the Hotel Denouement."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The children's visit to the Hotel Denouement turns out to be a reunion of sorts.  The children move through the hotel disguised as concierges and as they move through the hotel they meet many people that they have previously encountered in the first eleven books in A Series of Unfortunate Events.  Many of the people they meet are good people and volunteers.  They also meet many evil people.  The children also meet some people who may be evil| or they may be good.  Trying to decide whether certain individuals are good or bad could cause the children a Very Fine Distress.||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
We learn that Hotel Denouement is the last safe place on earth| and volunteers are arriving from all over.  Once the volunteers have arrived| certain foul criminals will be tried for their crimes!  Or will they?  There are lots and lots of plots and the criminals are one step ahead of the good guys| as can happen in the world.  As can also happen in the real world| the Baudelaire orphans are involved in the murder of a man by accident.  The situation gets hotter for everyone in the hotel as the Baudelaire orphans go on trial| everyone is blinded by their stupidity| a Venomous Fungal Disease is an impending doom| and we wonder how this series can possibly end with the next book.||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
This book is one of the best in the series.  This book does a fine job of preparing for the final book in the series.  Lemony Snicket answers some questions| but many more questions remain.  I await the final book with anxiety and excitement.  I wonder how Snicket can end this series in a way that will satisfy his faithful readers.||||||||||||||||||||||||

The Penultimate Peril provided me with a very mixed experience. On one hand, the mystery is unraveling and the end is in sight. On the other, there are severe plot deficiencies that deprive one of a wholy plesurable read. Here goes:"|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
1)Plot-too many old characters reintroduced. At a certain point it became so cliche to meet old guardians that you knew who was going to pop out at you next.|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
2)Sunny's Talk-yes| I know Sunny's gone and grown up. But the talk that provided one with hours of joyful deciphering is just gone. Sunny talks in complete sentences and even her words are so obvious that there's simply no point.||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
3)Language- Happily| the twists of phrases that leave you laughing hysterically are still there. You just might have to re-read something to guarantee that what you though you read is indeed there.||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
4)Morals-this book makes a big point of discussing nobility and its repercussions. WHile the early books were to simplistic in their approach to good vs. evil| this one loads up on heavy issues.You are basically left to realize that good isn't simple and that motives may or may not play an important role in judging the motives for the outcome.||||||||||||||||||||||||

When we last left Violet| Klaus| and Sunny that had met up with Kit Snicket on Briny Beach| and that's exactly where out story picks up.  She takes them to a hotel| where in just a few days| there will be a gathering of volunteers  at the last safe place.  However| we all know that nothing ends in sunshine & happiness for our favorite unfortunate orphans.|||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The book is very well paced| and a bit darker than some of the others in the series| but just as silly as well.  We see lots of familiar faces| and will have you wanting to reread the entire series over just to see if you missed the slighest bit of a clue.  We also meet some new characters| and discover some remarkable secrets.  We also run into some new questions| and ponder the true meaning of noble.  Right & wrong are not always black & white| especially for the Baudelaires.  The Penultimate Peril is a very enjoyable read| and is a must buy for fans of ASoUE.||||||||||||||||||

|||||||||||||||||||||||||
  Count Olaf miraculously escapes every time so it makes you want to read on. In the series there is dark humor (dark humor means it's sad but still a little funny) which pops up in different places. The main characters of the series have weird personalities| but they are memorable. Lemony Snicket has a different and interesting introduction in every book of the series. The best of these series is that Lemony Snicket is not the author's real name| so every time there's a mystery in the book there's also another mystery about who's writing it. Also I like the way how Lemony Snicket puts a fake picture of him and makes the mystery more mysterious.|||||||||||||||||||||||

R. Bird,The world is quiet here,9-Dec-05,""I recently downloaded a Fresh Air interview with author Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket) from several years ago.  In it, I learned that prior to writing """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""", Mr. Handler did not read a single solitary children's book.  He didn't immerse himself in the dry narration of E. Nesbit or take in the mock-gothic nature of Joan Aiken or even submerge himself in the wry humor of Roald Dahl.  Mr. Handler did none of this and yet he still managed to write what can best be described as the most original children's series of the new century.  Some books in this series work better than others (""""The Ersatz Elevator"""", for example is better by far than the slightly more forgettable, """"Slippery Slope"""") but not a single one could be described as weak or poorly written.  In this, the penultimate book in the series, we learn a heckuva lot more about VFD, the schism, the orphans' former guardians, and the nature of nobility and villainy.  There isn't as much action in, """"The Penultimate Peril"""".  You won't find insidious henchmen trying to saw children in half or swordfights or kids rappelling down elevator shafts.  What you will find is a whole book that lauds the beauty of libraries, a harpooning, letters written backwards, an enormous fire, bad Indian food, and what can best be called the final cliffhanger."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"When we last saw our heroes, the Baudelaire orphans had climbed into a taxi with a woman they knew only to be Kit Snicket.  Hoping that now, at last, they could get an answer all their questions, the Baudelaires are disappointed to find that Kit is just as mysterious and impossible to pin-down as every other adult they've met.  She takes them to the Hotel Denouement where they are immediately set up as concierges.  Their job?  Well, a big meeting is going to take place on Thursday and both villains and volunteers are gathering at Denouement.  The Baudelaires are charged to find out what they can about a guest known only as J.S.  Along the way they must befriend the manager Frank, avoid his evil twin Ernest, and attend to the guests' needs.  As the three do so they find that every incompetent and ill-equipped guardian they ever had is present (as well as the far rarer noble ones).  Everything is steaming to a head and the Baudelaires must figure out the secrets behind the hotel, avoid villainy themselves, and create an adequate signal to other members of VFD to indicate whether or not it is safe for the meeting to take place in what is known as the """"last safe place""""."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"What we have here is a book that makes it bloody clear to children everywhere that in this world there is no ultimately """"safe place"""".  The choices we make in our lives can never be followed to their ultimate conclusions because it's impossible to predict the minutia of chance.  The best we can hope for is to follow Kit Snicket's advice and """"observe everyone you see, and make such judgements yourselves"""".  The Baudelaires do a couple things in this book that seem sketchy or confusing to them.  By the end they know they've tried to do their best but villainy has seemingly still won out (though certainly not completely).  And to top it all off that most notorious of villains, Count Olaf, has shown a brief (very brief) moment of near-humanity.  Because of this, I've little fear that the Baudelaires will escape the book's final predicament with their souls as well as their bodies intact.  If someone doesn't write a book about the morality of """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" shortly after the publication of the 13th book, I can tell you right here and now that heads are gonna roll!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"As a librarian, I was much taken with the fact that the Hotel Denouement is organized like a library.  Guests are organized into rooms according to the Dewey Decimal System.  This isn't necessarily a new idea.  The Library Hotel at 299 Madison Avenue in New York City already did it years ago.  And while guests are not placed into rooms according to their occupations, each room is a different Dewey Decimal Number.  Still, """"The Penultimate Peril"""" does have a heroic librarian in its midst and (though I had not realized this before) in almost every book in the series the Baudelaires use a library to help them out of their predicaments.  So from the librarians of the world, Mr. Handler, I salute you.  Quietly."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"When, """"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"""" was written, it could be read as a parable of Gilded Age populism (the Scarecrow = the wise, but naive western farmers, the Tin Woodman = the dehumanized, Eastern factory workers, etc.).  So couldn't """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" be read as a parable for our own contemporary politics?  Think about it.  The """"good"""" adults in this book constantly disappoint the people who trust them because they aren't unified, allowing the villains to constantly seize control simply because bad guys are much stronger in the courage-of-their-convictions department.  Note the jab at Scalia on page 268 and you've a fairly convincing interpretation of modern politics.  Just a thought."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Faithful readers of Snicket know that on the last page of every book there's a note to Snicket's editor that offers some kind of clue as to the next book.  Unlike every other clue offered before, this one is clear, sweet, and succinct.  Readers will pore over it in vain for clues.  Until the final chapter in this series we'll just have to wait and hope for the best.  And that's a dangerous to thing to hope for where """"A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" is concerned."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

This is a completely subversive book."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"First of all, there is no way this can be considered children's literature.  In tone, in style, and in philosophical underpinnings, this book is the equal of David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* or David Mitchell's *Cloud Atlas*.  I'm not joking.  Snicket has extended his marvelously snarky Victorian narrator's voice into something that is meta-post-modern wonderful, a word that here means """"full of wonders."""""|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"The basic """"mirror"""" motif, the convoluted sentences, the convoluted plotting (which was always circular and inconclusive and in any case grinds to a halt-about which more in a moment), the moral uncertainty: by the time Snicket reaches the end of this, the longest of the books, it all has spiralled out of control and dissipates like the smoke of a building burning to the ground."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"I was about to type """"moral ambiguity,"""" but it occurs to me that morality in this book is not ambiguous.  The cartoon-character versions of good and evil which have sustained the series still operate, but they are reflected back and forth in Snicket's moral mirrors so often that we end up looking at multiple images, splintered and reassembled into scary chimeras of truth.  The climactic sequence, absolutely thrilling in its breathless action, takes a while to register, but Violet, Klaus, and Sunny take action against the forces of evil in ways that are in themselves questionable, and there is one moment in the ultimate penultimate peril which is truly shocking.  The children's acceptance of a kind of *Realpolitik* is disturbing, but then again, dear reader, have we not spent the previous eleven books wishing they would just kick butt?  And now, finally, they have."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"I say """"finally"""" because it is my belief that this is the end.  I know Mr. Daniel Handler, Snicket's spokesperson, has been quoted as saying the last book will come out in the fall of 2006, but I have reason to believe he's lying.  He has always hinted there would be thirteen books in the series, and there are: twelve in the history of the Baudelaires, and the *Unauthorized Autobiography* which came between Books Eight and Nine.  The location of this book, the Hotel Denouement, is an in-joke, of course; the denouement of a play always comes at the end.  Technically, as Snicket points out, the denouement is not the very end, but also technically, the denouement is the untying of the knots of the plot, which signally does not occur in this book.  """"Unravelling"""" would be a more apt translation in this case.  Snicket throws out enough hints and clues and observations to lead us to a gorgeously complex denouement-but he does not do it.  I believe he has chosen to leave all the loose ends loose."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
The title of the book| *Penultimate Peril*| suggests that there is one more volume to come| but this book reads like a finale.  The ambiguity of the Beaudelaires' situation| of VFD| of Olaf and Snicket and all the rest| is reflected (!) in the ending| which at face value is just another cliffhanger| but which I believe is the final ending.  Do we get answers?  Do we get a happy ending?  Do we get an *un*happy ending?  No| no| and no.  And that's Mr. Handler's joke.|||||||||||||||

"The Penultimate Peril"""" finds the Baudelaire orphans ensconced at the Hotel Denouement, disguised as concierges in an effort to study the guests to see if they are noble volunteers or ignoble villains.  Violet, Klaus and Sunny have little but appearances, which can always be deceiving, to go on and happen to find themselves possibly working for the villains against their knowledge.  The three Baudelaires must try to uncover various mysteries regarding the VFD before a meeting of volunteers scheduled for that Thursday takes place.

"As usual, """"The Penultimate Peril"""" is an outstanding companion to the books that make up The Series of Unfortunate Events.  The trademark humor of Lemony Snicket is in place, bur resonates at a much deeper level this time.  Readers know that the Baudelaire saga must come to an end with the next book, but are left to wonder if the mysteries that haunt Violet, Klaus and Sunny, and that tie them to Count Olaf, will ever be solved.

Are you wandering what Violet| Klaus| and Sunny got into this time? In this second to the last fiction book of the series the siblings face a series of important questions. These questions make them realize that they might have hit a dead end. Faced with conflicting decisions as they watch things fall apart around them. This is not looking to good for the orphans.|||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
" This book was definitely near the top of my list of best books. This is because of the conflicting emotions. Everything seems to be falling apart around the Baudelaires. The decisions they make are extremely important. I really like the twist in the story throughout series. I can't wait for the next book to come out since it is last book. Coincidentally, it is book number 13. This book is definitely one of the best books I have ever read."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

Much of it focuses on the thin demarcation between good and evil, a phrase which here means """"tiny little barrier between thoughtful, clean, courteous youngsters and stupid, filthy and rude Count Olaf and his minions."""""|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
I especially like how this references back to what happened in the previous books subtly at times (as in references narrator Snicket makes to things he found during his research). Because of this| people who are new to the series will be quite lost if they choose this one to begin with (if they choose to read such a dreadful series as this at all whenTHE LITTLEST ELF is so much cheerier).||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"As usual, Snicket finds a way to slide in plenty of educational things without making it sound dull (as in making the layout of the Hotel Denouement line up with the Dewey Decimal System) and plenty of florid prose. Sunny's hidden humor is also topnotch (She exclaims """"Scalia!"""" to state that perhaps the literal interpretation is not always the most appropriate.)"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

"On to the book itself... in this volume Our Heroes the young Beaudelaires give us that particular pleasure that comes from re-encountering nearly *all* of the vile villains, rotten rapscallions, and heartless hooligans they've escaped through clever collaboration and endless effort (despite their lousy luck) since their parents perished in that colossal conflagration (a phrase which here means something like """"pernicious plot perpetrated by avaricious, arsonous actors"""") nearly eleven editions ago.  Among the hindering hallways of the Hotl Denouement the reader can learn the Dewey Decimal system, the onerous obligations (and occasional opportunities) of a common concirge, what """"Justice is Blind"""" does NOT mean, and how to persist despite regular reminders that one's best brain-work still might very well be completely """"WRONGGGG!"""". We are also reminded that not all siblings with the same age and birth-date are twins, not all reflections are illusions, that a sauna has more merits than one, that a picnic can be just the thing when enemies are everywhere and menacing misfortunes mount, and that athletic tap-dancing cow-poke pirates are not necessarily as formidable as they first seem.

Kit Snicket has asked Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to dress up/disguise themselves as concierges (hotel staff) in order to become flaneurs (spies) for mysterious volunteer organization.  Their risk mission is to observe all of the guests staying at Hotel Denouement in order to figure out who are the volunteers, who are the villains, and who the mysterious J,S. is.  Is J.S. a man or woman?  Is J.S. on V.F.D.'s side or on Count Olaf's side?  These are questions the Baudelaire siblings must answer before Thursday's trial in order to put Olaf behind bars once and far all.  On top of that, the children have to be able to distinguish the two hotel mangers, who are identical brothers, from each other: the nice Frank and the evil Ernest.  Plus, V.F.D. crows are to deliver the sugar bowl to the last safe place.  Can the Baudelaires manage every complicated task given to them?  The conclusion of this book is that you would imagine -  Chapter 13 is simply unbelievable (and what happens to Count Olaf and Esme Squalor is equally shocking)!  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes A Series of Unfortunate Events and enjoys reading a good mystery book, or simply a book discussing very serious matters.  This is probably the best book in the entire series (perhaps even better thanThe End (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 13)) because the readers really sees how three """"innocent"""" kids pass out of childhood and begin to turn into what they most fear: villains.  In previous books, the orphans had to lie to an almost-blind man and set a carnival on fire in order to escape dangerous situations.  Now, the unfortunate Baudelaires even kill one of the hotel managers with a harpoon gun; they realize that they aren`t as noble as they thought they were.  The theme of evil and wickedness in the world in a portrayed perfectly inLord of the Flies : (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century) (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century), but Daniel Handler handles the concept very well.  It's quite sad to read what ambition and corruption can lead to, but neverless, this a marvelous book worth every penny.  The Sebald Code and other codes fromLemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiographyare actually used in this book, and many of the Baudelaire's previous guardians return for big important V.F.D. gathering!  A truly wonderful book, but maybe a bit too strong for little children."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Penultimate-Peril-Unfortunate-Events-Book/product-reviews/0064410153/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"|||||||||||||||||||||||||

|||||||||||||||||||||||||
From the very beginning| the Baudelaires are thrown into an ambiguous world where everyone speaks in enigmas| volunteers have villainous identical brothers| and even the simplest action is likely to be part of a dark and convoluted plot. Unable to tell who is to be trusted and who isn't| they wonder endlessly about whether their actions are helping their friends or their enemies| and end up having to take some big decisions that may or may not have a right answer.||||||||||||||||||||

"All this is set in the brilliantly imagined Hotel Denouement, and if you know what the word """"denouement"""" means then you would be right in expecting matters to come to a climax here. Finally, many of our niggling questions are answered, but many remain, and the book is filled with a sense of unfathomable mystery."|||||||||||||||||||||||||
|||||||||||||||||||||||||
"Without revealing too much, I will say that the Baudelaires end up discovering some very shocking facts about their parents, about the world they live in, and about themselves, and suddenly nothing seems as simple or as clear-cut as we first imagined. The hotel, a backwards place whose reflection in a pond is the *real* Hotel Denouement, could be a metaphor for the world.
