||||||||||||||||||
"Here the poor Baudelaire's are placed with the Village of Fowl Devotees, and when they learn the name of the village, they hope that perhaps they might get some answers to VFD. Mr. Poe is operating here under the aphorism, """"It takes a village to raise a child"""", but as usual he's completely off base and out of touch with reality, because the village he's sending these kids to is, well, if I were to pay them a compliment, off-kilter."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
For example| the RULES. They are absurd| but absurd in a hysterical fashion that leaves you laughing and wanting to hear what the next pointless rule is.||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"Rule #920 clearly states that no one may talk while on the platform [at the council of elders] unless you are a police officer."""" To further enforce this point, an elder states: """"You're orphans, not police officers, so shut up."""""||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"Rule #19,833 """"states that no villains are allowed within the city limits."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"Rule # 67 """"clearly states that no citizen is allowed to build or use any mechanical devices."""" Poor Violet!!"||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
Those are only a few| but here's the worst part of it all: the punishment for breaking any of these rules| regardless of the rule| is to be burned at the stake!|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"We learn things in this book, as usual, such as the migratory patterns of crows. There is a Neverland Tree, and a fountain shaped like a fish. There is also, I'm sorry to say, the appearance of some people who break Rule #19,833, but due to """"mob rule"""", those people convince the village elders that the real villains are the Baudelaires, and they face the most ignoble, not to mention terrifying and life threatening, likelihood of being burned at the stake."||||||||||||||||||

Creativity abounds| especially in the form of the lost Quagmire triplets. But I'll zip it and say no further on that.|||||||||||||||||

When the triplets tried to help the Baudelaires,  the triplets became captives of Olaf."||||||||||||||||||

Since then| the orphans have felt a sense of responsibility towards the triplets.|||||||||||||||||

In this episode of the series| the Baudelaires have arrived at the village of V.F.D.  They chose to travel to this village| because the name of the village| V.F.D.| matches a clue that was given to the orphans by the triplets.||||||||||||||

The village believes that it takes a village to raise a child.  Yet| when the orphans arrive| the villagers prove to be poor guardians for the orphans.||||||||||||||||

Soon the orphans receive clues that the Quagmires are close by.  After a murder occurs| the evil count makes his appearance.|||||||||||||||||

Once again he is in disguise so the adults don't recognize him.  The count frames the orphans for the murder.  Unfortunately| the only punishment for being a rule breaker in V.F.D. is burning at the stake.|||||||||||||||||

The previous books simply talked about the three children struggling from Count Olaf's clutches and eventually survive. The same pattern repeats from book 1 to book 6 with Count Olaf planning a new scheme to get the Baudelaire fortune and them escaping at the end without Count Olaf getting captured."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
In this book| the 3 three children are convicted of murder of Count Olaf when Count Olaf killed the look alike( one eyebrow and a tatoo on his ankle) himself. The strange twist then begins where the children have to run away from the police. Count Olaf| now thought to be killed is on the loose and is free to roam around trying to catch the children. He doesn't need disguises anymore but| on the contrary| it's the children who need to disguise themselves to escape both Count Olaf's clutches and the police.||||||||||||||

It's quite interesting figuring out what new disguise Count Olaf would wear next but it's quite lame to have it repeated for 5 times| with 5 different books for just one disguise. It's more fun| though| to have the children disguising because | as we know| Count Olaf is a very clever man. It's fun to read about how 3 prodigies escape then 1 filthy man trying to get their fortune all the time.||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
It's a fast read and the author sure has a wide variety of phrases and vocabulary to go with explainations. The pictures add to the fun because as you go along the book| you really get the picture of the situations and when you see the illustrations| it just proves that the book is really descriptive and it can give you an image which looks totally like the pictures drawn.||||||||||||||||

Love it!||||||||||||||||||

I stumbled across The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket (I hate that pen name though) and I loved it. I read up to the 7th book and cannot wait for the 8th. These books were  refreshingly short and entertaining.  A Series of Unfortunate Events tells the long and sad epic, throughout many books, of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire whose parents have perished in a house fire and who are left alone with the evil Count Olaf. Each are well developed and unique characters whose abilities come in useful at every turn only to be squashed by the evil doings of Olaf and his troupe. The books get better and better as you go along and meet characters like:"||||||||||||||||||
~Isadora and Duncan Quagmire| two triplets who are also journalists and poets|||||||||||||||||
~Esme Squalor| the fancy pinstriped financial advisor|||||||||||||||||
~Vice Principal Nero| the self-proclaimed genius violinist|||||||||||||||||

In this new chapter of their lives the three Baudalaire orphans find themselves unwanted by any of their relatives because of their recent """"unfortunate events"""". However the get the good news or you can consider it bad news that the village of V.F.D whose motto is """"IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD"""" wants to adopt them. The orphans are excited as they embark on their new journey as they very well know that this village might hold the secrets to the Quagmire triplet's secret about V.F.D."||||||||||||||||||
However when they arrive there they find thousands of crows to greet them and thounsands of ridiculous rules they have to follow. Plus the three of them have to do all the chores they village elders require them. It seems the only person who actrully accepts the orphans to care for is the village keeper named Hector. However he isn't much help because he gets skittish around the village elder for their stupid rules. The good thing is that he keeps a secret inventing studio and a secret library( which by the way are against the rules in V.F.D.) for Violet and Klaus to enjoy. The plot thickens when they kids find couplets written by Isable Quagmire under the tree next to Hecoter's shack and then the three Baudlaires get the news that Count Olaf(Known in V.F.D. as Count Omar) has been captured. However as all the unfortunate things are for them this one can also be counted for this Count Olaf is false. Before the kids can get information about him he is mysterouisly murdered and guess what? The detective who comes to review the case is no other than Count Olaf in one of his new ridiculous diguises. And he accuses the kids of murder! Can the Baudlaires find a solution to their neverending series of unfortunate events?||||||||||||||||||
"This 7th book was totally genious by Lemony Snicket! It is one of my favorites. The 8th book which I have already read can be said to be even better.

'It takes a village to raise a child' is the saying. They eventually pick V.F.D( Village of Fowl Devotees). Violet, Klaus and Sunny ofcourse have no idea what it meant. They jump at anything with the initials V.F.D, trying to find the answer. Again luck runs out. But that's what keeps this series going. It just keeps getting more hectic. But there time at V.F.D is short lived and more woeful and terrible. The miserable events the Baudelaires go through just follow them."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
From the departing bus| the Baudelaires push their way across the flat|dusty and dry land and into the town of V.F.D. With strict rules the Council of Elders rule the town. But basically| the town is over swept by migrating crows. Hector| the handyman is their new guardian. Skittish in front of the Council of Elders| Hector's specialty is mexican food. By night| the crows bunch around Hector's tree| leaving Isadora's poems in the morning. It only takes a smart Klaus to figure out the riddle to Isadora and Duncan's whereabouts. Also| we see Jacques Snicket. Before he is murdered| people tell he should be burned at the stake because he is Count Omar or Olaf. Tattoo of an eye on his ankle| Jacques is accused of being a villain. But the inclusion of this brief character just brings in more unanswered questions to the Snicket mystery and V.F.D. Suddenly| after staying in a prison cell overnight| Jacques is found murdered. Detective Dupin comes to investigate. Is Dupin Olaf? And after introducing mob pychcology| Dupin gets what he wanted. The Baudelaires in the most dirtiest| yuckiest| grottiest| slimy and damp cell. Soon| two of the Baudelaires would be burn at the stake| leaving one of Baudelaires. But Violet's inventing skills help to break out and cleverly Klaus finds the Quagmires in a crow shaped fountain.
||||||||||||||||||
Suddenly| everbody is on a hunt to find the Baudelaires. Every V.F.D citizen is after them and the Quagmires. Will Hector's invention(which Violet improved) be able to get the five  out of this horible| horible mess. You'll see.||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
Again Snicket provides humour and an exciting story. Also| you'll find out how Isadora sent those poems. Gruelling chores and an angry mob| Snicket excites readers| though this story has a turn. Convicted of murder. The Baudelaires find another  person dead only because of Olaf| and the end result is a stupid one. Why can't people be more sensible. Olaf continues to trick people when he ain't that smart and skillful. Esme also has a disguise. The last seen where Esme shoots the harpoon at the invention and Hector remarks how he lost the food supply etc. is funny. I recommend you buy this book. It sure is a good one.||||||||||||||

"Jerome was the last person who was willing to take the Baudelaires in.  Mr. Poe, however, had been able to find an entire village willing to raise the children, the village of V.F.D. Remembering the clue that the Quagmires had told them, the Baudelaires were hoping that V.F.D. would assist them in solving the death of their parents and the mysterious tunnel they had discovered from 667 Dark Avenue to the remains of their family home.  Alas, V.F.D. had never heard of the phrase, """"It takes a village to raise a child"""" and treated the children rather bad.  About all that V.F.D. cared for were their migrating crows that ruled the town.  In fact, that's what this V.F.D. was all about; they are the Village of Fowl Devotees."||||||||||||||||||

Still| the children's stay at V.F.D. wasn't completely a waste.

But after strange and spinning events, they are put in jail by a cop they've been accquainted with before and a suspicious """"detective""""."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Vile-Village-Unfortunate-Events-No/product-reviews/0064408655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||

In the book the author pokes fun at a certain former President's wife for the now-famous phrase, """"It takes a village to raise a child.""""  (It used to take a mother and a father, but that's a different subject.)  And the readers' mad thirst for more VFD clues will be just the tiniest bit dampened, particularly by the fact that the Baudelaire orphans are sent to live in a village simply called VFD.  Other interest points include the use of poetry to reveal developing plot points and the fact that the ruthless Count Olaf has very little """"page-time"""".  Overall, THE VILE VILLAGE will drive the reader even further and deeper into this unfortunate saga."||||||||||||||||||

As we once again join the unlucky Baudelaire orphans, they are sent by their banker, the ever-tussive Mr Poe, to the village of V.F.D under a government scheme based on the aphorism that it takes a whole village to raise a child. Having already suffered the loss of their parents, the threat of marriage, slave labour, hypnosis, a terrible boarding school, being thrown down a lift shaft and the murder of their Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine at the hands of the evil Count Olaf and his nefarious assistants, the siblings are ever-vigilant of his reappearance. Luckily these well-mannered and uncomplaining children are also very resourceful: Violet invents, Klaus researches and Sunny bites. Snickets tone throughout is apologetic, sincere and matter-of-fact as he relates the unfortunate events in the childrens lives; his imaginative and even surreptitiously educational style will hold much appeal for younger readers.  Snickets word and phrase definitions are often hilarious. This instalment sees the Baudelaires  lodged with Hector the Handyman and forced to do chores for the village. But their time with Hector is actually quite good, as Violet works on improving Hectors self-sustaining hot air mobile home, while Klaus scours the library for loopholes in V.F.D. rules and Sunny bites fallen branches whilst waiting on clues of their friends, the Quagmire Triplets. But they soon fall foul of the many village rules : Detective Dupin throws them into jail and threatens them with burning at the stake. And just who is Jaques Snicket and what was the message about the Baudelaire parents he was prevented from giving them before his murder? Of course Count Olaf and his girlfriend, Esme Squalor are up to their usual tricks. As always, the alliterative titles are delightful and Brett Helquist provides some wonderfully evocative illustrations. What is in store for the orphans now?

The end of this book revolutionizes the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, and shoots forward in a whole new direction."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
In this book| the Baudelaire orphans are taken into a village where they live for a short period of time with a man named Hector. Hector and the Baudelaires are in charge of cleaning the entire village each and every day. Suddenly| the Baudelaires keep receiving short lines of poetry from Isadora Quagmire| one of the Baudelaire's friends who was taken away from them twice already in the previous two books.|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
The Baudelaires finally realize that Isadora is trying to tell them the location of where she and her brother Duncan are hiding| right when the Baudelaires are thrown in jail for being falsely accused of murdering someone.|||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
This someone is the reason why the books following The Vile Village are what they are. The man's name is Jacques Snicket. Sound familiar? He has one eyebrow and a tattoo of an eye on his ankle| just like Count Olaf. The villagers of the Village of Fowl Devotees mistake him for Count Olaf| who is once again dressed up in one of his disguises. The man named Jacques Snicket is tied to a stake and is ready to be burned| but the next day| before the villagers are able to burn him| the Baudelaires are framed for murdering him.|||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
It's not surprising that Count Olaf was the one who framed them for murder. Because of this| the entire world now thinks that the Baudelaires are murderers| and that Count Olaf is dead. This is a verrrrrrry important part to the series| and a very suspenseful one at that.|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"That's just the first part of the book though. The rest of the book, well... You can find out what happens to the Baudelaires and the Quagmires and Hector and Olaf and all of the other characters when you read it. This book is probably one of the best ones yet, for it contains much suspense and reveals many secrets about V.F.D. You'll have to read it in order to see that The Vile Village is much more than just the Baudelaire's new home, then Count Olaf's disguise, and then the Baudelaires leaving their new home; oh yes, it's much more than that, much more."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Vile-Village-Unfortunate-Events-No/product-reviews/0064408655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||

||||||||||||||||||
In terms of the story| Snicket follows the usual winning formula| with the Baudelaires searching for a new beginning| and finding some hope before the devilish count shows up and spoils everything. The author also continues to use his hilarious structure| presenting definitions of words in a creative way| letting Klaus and Violet translate what her little sister wants to say| and distributing a few surprises here and there.||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"The siblings stay in VFD is interesting to say the least, where they meet a group of ancient citizens with a large set of rules, a kind person who does not have the guts to stand up to injustice and a baffling mystery in the form of a set of poems. The series have been increasing in intensity and the characters are gaining more and more depth. Thus, fans of this series will not be disappointed with this novel."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Vile-Village-Unfortunate-Events-No/product-reviews/0064408655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||

Bird,""Quoth the crows, """"Squawk!"""""",24-Jun-04,""This is the first book in the Series of Unfortunate Events that I really wish I had heard on tape.  Many parts of this tale should be heard spoken aloud to be truly appreciated.  As it was, I was resigned to instead reading the book while working out on a particularly nasty elliptical runner all the time pondering the sad fate of the Baudelaire orphans and their friends.  In """"The Vile Village"""", the plot not only thickens but congeals.  Here at last are more clues about the mysterious VFD.  Here the name """"Snicket"""" has arrived within the text of these pages rather than as merely its author and narrator.  Here the clues add up and up."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"Taking the phrase, """"It takes a village to raise a child"""", a little too seriously, the Baudelaire orphans have now been officially adopted by none other than an entire village.  The orphans have chosen this particular location because of its fascinating name, VFD.  As you might recall, these initials were part of the Quagmire triplets' last cryptic words to the Baudelaires before they were officially kidnapped by the loathsome Count Olaf.  As it turns out, the town is actually named the Village of Fowl Devotees due to its enormous crow population.  While there, the orphans are required to do the chores for all the townspeople and live with the kindly handyman, Hector.  It isn't long before mysterious messages in the form of rhyming couplets start appearing, apparently from the Quagmires.  It's up to the Baudelaires to find their friends and save their own skin before an angry mob torches them forthwith."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"While the tension runs high in this particular Snicket outing, I found it strangely hopeful at the end.  Obviously this was not the author's intention, but that's how I felt anyway.  Though tensions run high in this tale, the angry mob is about as threatening as the witch hunters in """"Monty Python and the Holy Grail"""".  Personally I was delighted when I was able to figure out where the Quagmires were being hidden by page 143.  Then I remembered that I am currently 26 years of age and this book was written, ostensibly, for kids.  Still, I think I've also figured out what VFD stands for, and only time will show if I am right or wrong."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"The story itself is just as you would like it to be.  The orphans have a little more enjoyable down time here and (much to my relief) far better food than they've had in some time.  One squiggle of a squabble I did have involved the crows perching continually in the Nevermore tree.  Shouldn't they be ravens?  Otherwise, I liked Count Olaf's latest disguise (hence my wish that I could hear the audio of this book) and I especially enjoyed the clues and mystery in the tale.  The author has the difficult job of continually upping the ante, as it were, while keeping these stories invigorating and interesting.  At the end of this book the Baudelaires are in the direst of straits, but I have little doubt that they'll eventually pull through.  Call it a bolt of optimism from the blue, if you will."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Vile-Village-Unfortunate-Events-No/product-reviews/0064408655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||

Count Olaf adopts his most outrageous persona in this installment of the series with the help of a new accomplice. In the village| ambigiously named V.F.D.| the rules need special attention to be enforced. Count Olaf is just cunning enough to accept this role. As the Baudelaires live with village appointee Hector| they must complete daily tasks while searching for the whereabouts of two Quagmire Triplets. As is usually the case| the clues will lead readers in the right direction. One only has to wonder how the village of fowl devotees and Count Olaf will prevent the orphans plan from being perfectly executed.||||||||||||||

Further| many of the people for whom they do chores little appreciate what the children do.  Lastly| the children and everyone in town must follow an extensive list of incredibly ridiculous rules.|||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
Soon after the children arrive in town they find a note (a rhyming couplet) from their previously kidnapped friends| Duncan and Isadora Quagmire| kidnapped two books ago by Count Olaf.  As time proceeds| the children find more couplets written by Isadora Quagmire.  The children hope and believe the couplets will lead them to the location of the Quagmires so that the children might rescue them.|||||||||||||||

As always happens to the Baudelaires| Count Olaf shows up again and as usual he has assorted followers that are with him| including one surprise returning character (I'm not telling!).

It seems like each book in this series is better than the last.

Additionally| there are strong educational messages as the children typically have to rely on their own resources and abilities to escape from Count Olaf| typically using their reading skills and innovative abilities to improvise and overcome.  Sometimes the educational messages are very strong| such as when the author explicitly defines the meanings of words within the stories.||||||||||||||

"I thought this story was intriguing in a variety of ways, and the author manages to introduce a touch of science fiction or fantasy in the story in the method the children try to use to escape.

The cons:||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
The self sustaining hot air mobile home is a little far fetched| but it is a Lemony Snicket book and its kinda supposed to be. This probably won't bother anyone| and it doesn't bother me but I had to think of at least 1 con!||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
The pros:||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
The setting is really great. A city with marble buildings and fancy fountains covered in crows in the middle of a desert! It's really a creative setting for a book.||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
The Quagmires return! The Baudelaires finally rescue the Quagmires and get to see them for more than two seconds in a an elevator shaft. It was really cool how Isidora used her poems as a code to tell the kids where they were.||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"Count Olaf's disguise was the best yet. I won't give it away but it was """"cool"""" hahaha!"||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
The ending was great! It was the saddest ending yet in the series but it was exciting all the same. Sunny learns to walk and the Baudelaires finally get a chance to pause and see that there baby sister is growing up. They are also on there own rather than under the care of Mr. Poe| so it leaves endless options for the next book.|||||||||||||||||

There, they meet Hector, who takes care of them.  Since there are so many rules at this village, Hector wants to escape.  Therefore, he tells the Baudelaires a secret that he is building a machine that will go up in the air and never come back.  Also, the Baudelaires encounter some mysteries about the Quagmires and of Count Olaf, who disguised once again.  However, they are left behind as murderes and Count Olaf escapes once again."||||||||||||||||||
Ofcourse| I love this book.  Like all the Unfortunate series| this book is full of adventures and mysteries.  Yet| this book brings tears| for the Baudelaires are tragically left behind.  When they come to a happy event| it is ruined in a flash.  Why can't there ever be a continuous happy moment for them?  Still| I would have to say it is humorous.  Thank goodness that all of the Baudelaires are good at something| for if they weren't they would have never survived any of thesse treacherous  events.|||||||||||
"My favorite part in this book was when the Baudelaires finally discovered the secret about where the Quagmires were hiding.  Everyday, the Quagmires sent a poem which gave clues about where Count Olaf had hidden them.  Finally, Violet and Klaus discovered the secret and rescued their friends.  How clever the author is to think of such an idea!  I was shocked that the Quagmires were hiding in a fountain.  However, the happy moment ended when only the Quagmires escaped with Hector on th machine."",5.0 out of 5 stars,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Vile-Village-Unfortunate-Events-No/product-reviews/0064408655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"||||||||||||||||||

"I first came to this series after watching the tie-in movie """"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events"""". I love the series for its superb characterization, lovely writing, quirky plotlines, and deeply dark humor. This seventh book in the series carries on the tradition and will not disappoint fans."||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
"Like the rest of the novels in this series, this book is very slender and can be whipped through in a few hours. However, the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in their new home in the mysteriously-named village of V.F.D. The orphans have been sent to the village to live because """"it takes a village to raise a child"""", but when they arrive, they realize they are expected to be slaves for the inhabitants of the entire town. Maybe their new placement is worth it, though, if the entire village can keep Count Olaf away...?"||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||
A note about the audiobook edition of this book: this installment returns to the superb narration of Tim Curry that the early books in the series featured. Curry does an incredible job with the story and it is impossible to not be drawn into his deep| rich narration as he follows the orphans in their adventures.|||||||||||||||||
